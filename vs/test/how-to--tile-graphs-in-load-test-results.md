# How to: Tile Graphs in Load Test Results
You can arrange load test results graphs in any of several patterns. You can tile up to four graphs both while a load test is running, or when the load test has completed using the Load Test Analyzer. For more information, see [Load Test Analyzer Overview](../test/load-test-analyzer-overview.md).  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
-   Visual Studio Enterprise  
  
### To tile load test results graphs  
  
1.  In the Load Test Analyzer, choose **Graphs** on the load test toolbar.  
  
     This displays load test results in graphs.  
  
2.  On the load test toolbar, choose the down arrow next to the panels button.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The name of this button, as indicated by the hover text for it, matches the last selection that was made with the button, such as **Four Panels Grid**.  
  
     Clicking this arrow displays all the options for tiling the load test results graphs.  
  
3.  Select a tiling option, such as **Three Panels Weighted Right**.  
  
     The graphs are displayed in the tiling orientation that you chose.  
  
4.  (Optional) To display a different graph in a particular position, select the graph you want, such as "Controller and Agents," in the drop-down list above the currently displayed graph.  
  
     The graph that you chose is displayed in the position where you made the selection.
