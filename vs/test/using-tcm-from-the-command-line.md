# Using TCM from the command line
You can run test cases with associated automation from the command line using tcm.exe instead of using the user interface provided by Microsoft Test Manager. This enables you to start runs automatically from a batch file. Then, for example, you can decide to schedule that batch file to run every time that a build is completed.  
  
 The tcm.exe command-line utility lets you perform the following tasks:  
  
-   Import automated tests into a test plan  
  
-   Run tests that are part of a test plan from the command line  
  
-   View a list of test items and their corresponding IDs to use when you import tests or run tests  
  
## Tasks  
 Use the following topics to help you run tcm.exe from the command line:
