# tcm: Running Tests from a Test Plan Using the Command Line Utility
You can run automated tests that are part of a test plan from the command line. This lets you start a test run using a batch file so that you can schedule a run. You can also manage the test runs from the command line. If you want to export a test run so that a developer can view the test results using [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], you can use **tcm** to accomplish this. You can also publish test run results from a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] test run file (.trx) using **tcm**. You can specify which results from this test run file that you want to publish back to your test plan. You can use the following **tcm** commands to accomplish these tasks:  
  
-   **tcm run /create**  
  
-   **tcm run /list**  
  
-   **tcm run /execute**  
  
-   **tcm run /abort**  
  
-   **tcm run /delete**  
  
-   **tcm run /export**  
  
-   **tcm run /publish**  
  
 tcm.exe is located in **\<Drive:>\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio \<version>\Common7\IDE** on any computer that has Visual Studio Enterprise or Visual Studio Test Professional.  
  
 For more information about how to import automated tests into your test project and set up your test plan to run these tests, see [Create Test Cases from an Assembly of Automated Tests](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d7a31fc7-7773-4bcc-a8e2-65279934559b) and [Run automated tests from the command line using tcm](../test/run-automated-tests-from-the-command-line-using-tcm.md).

|**/suiteid**:`id`|Specifies the test suites that you want to run.<br /><br /> It can also specify the test suite to use when you publish a test run. **Note:**  To find the suite id, you can list the test suites for a test plan. For more information, see [tcm: Listing test plans, test suites, test configurations, and environments](../test/tcm--listing-test-plans--test-suites--test-configurations--and-environments.md). **Tip:**  To run more than one test suite, you can use the /querytext parameter.|

|**/runowner**:`owner`|Optional. Specifies the owner of the test run.|  
|**/builddir**:`directory`|Optional. Specifies the build directory to use to locate the test assemblies for the automated test. If this is not specified the build location is used based on the build that is currently assigned to the test plan.|

|**/noprompt**|Optional. Specifies that the user is not prompted to confirm deletion of a test run.|  
|**/login**:`username,[password]`|Optional. Specifies the name and password of a user who is logged on to the application-tier server for [!INCLUDE[esprtfs](../codequality/includes/esprtfs_md.md)] and who has permissions to run the command. You would use this option if your Windows credentials do not have the appropriate permissions, or you are using basic authentication, or you are not connected to a domain.<br /><br /> To login to Visual Studio Team Services, you will also need to use **/allowalternatecredentials** listed below.|  
|**/allowalternatecredentials**|This flag must be specified in addition to the **/login** parameter when connecting to Visual Studio Team Services. (This flag is only available if you have Visual Studio 2013 Update 4 or greater.)|  
  
 You can add parameters for **/collection** and **/teamproject** to the **tcm.exe.config** XML file which is located in the same directory as **tcm.exe**: **\<Drive:>\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio \<version>\Common7\IDE**. If you add these to the file, you do not have to enter them on the command line each time you run a **tcm** command. You can add these keys and their values to the file, as follows, in the **appSettings** section:  
  
```  
  
<appSettings>  
     <add key="TeamFoundationServer" value="http://<ServerName:Port/VirtualDirectoryName/CollectionName>"/>  
     <add key ="TeamProject" value="DinnerNow"/>  
</appSettings>  
  
```  
  
## Examples  
  
## Running Tests and Managing Test Runs  
 The following examples assume that you have started a Visual Studio command prompt. (Go to Start, All Programs, Microsoft Visual Studio, Visual Studio Tools, Developer Command Prompt.)  
  
 The command prompt opens to the folder: **\<drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio \<version>\VC**  
  
 Change directory to the folder that contains the assembly built from your test project.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  To run automated tests from the command line using tcm.exe, you must have your test cases associated with your automated tests. You must also set up your test plan correctly to use a build to locate the automated tests to run if you do not specify the build information on the command line. For more information about how to do this, see [How to: Create Test Cases from an Assembly of Automated Tests Using tcm.exe](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d7a31fc7-7773-4bcc-a8e2-65279934559b).  
  
 To get the necessary ids for the following commands, you may have to use **tcm** to list the test artifacts and their ids. For more information about how to do this, see [tcm: Listing test plans, test suites, test configurations, and environments](../test/tcm--listing-test-plans--test-suites--test-configurations--and-environments.md) and [Run automated tests from the command line using tcm](../test/run-automated-tests-from-the-command-line-using-tcm.md).  
  
 The following command runs tests using a test point query:  
  
```  
tcm run /create /title:"Nightly Run" /planid:1 /querytext:"SELECT * FROM TestPoint WHERE ConfigurationId=13" /settingsname:"<Name of your automated test settings>" /testenvironment:"<Name of a matching environment>" /collection:<CollectionURL> /teamproject:<Team Project name>  
```  
  
 The following command runs tests using a specific test suite and configuration:  
  
```  
tcm run /create /title:"Nightly Run" /planid:1 /suiteid:5 /configid:13 /settingsname:"<Name of your automated test settings>" /testenvironment:"<Name of a matching environment>" /collection:<CollectionURL> /teamproject:<Team Project name>  
```  
  
 The following command runs tests using a specific ID:  
  
```  
Tcm run /execute /id:1207 /collection:<CollectionURL> /teamproject:<Team Project name>  
```  
  
 The following command lists the test runs for a specific test plan:  
  
```  
tcm run /list /planid:1 /collection:<CollectionURL> /teamproject:<Team Project name>  
```  
  
 The following command deletes a specific test run:  
  
```  
tcm run /delete /id:1009 /collection:<CollectionURL> /teamproject:<Team Project name>  
```  
  
 The following command exports a test run to a .trx file:  
  
```  
tcm run /export /id:1273 /resultsfile:"c:\temp\latest.trx" /collection:<CollectionURL> /teamproject:<Team Project name>  
```  
  
 The following command publishes a test run for a specific test suite and test configuration and reassigns the owner. This updates the existing test points for the test cases in the test suite paired with this configuration to the results in the .trx file:  
  
```  
tcm run /publish /suiteid:5 /configid:13 /resultowner:"<Name of new owner>" /resultsfile:"c:\temp\latest.trx" /collection:<CollectionURL> /teamproject:<Team Project name>  
```
