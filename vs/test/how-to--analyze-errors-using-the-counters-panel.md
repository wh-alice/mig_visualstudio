# How to: Analyze Errors Using the Counters Panel
The Counters panel is visible in the Graphs view and the Tables view in the Load Test Analyzer while a load test is running, or when you are analyzing a load test result. For more information, see [Analyzing Load Test Results in the Graphs View](../test/analyzing-load-test-results-in-the-graphs-view-of-the-load-test-analyzer.md), [Analyzing Load Test Results and Errors in the Tables View](../test/0a84bda3-6051-45eb-9c7f-d57419e1f97d.md) and [How to: Access Load Test Results for Analysis](../test/how-to--access-load-test-results-for-analysis.md).  
  
 The **Errors** node in the Counters panel contains all the errors that were detected during the load test. The Errors node contains several sub-category error nodes that are specific to different kinds of errors. For example, **Exceptions** and **HTTP Errors**.

## Analyzing Errors  
  
#### To analyze errors in the Counters panel  
  
1.  After a load test completes, or after you load a test result, in the Load Test Analyzer's toolbar, choose either **Graphs** or **Tables**.  
  
     The **Counters** panel displays in either the Graphs view or the Tables view.  
  
2.  If the Counters panel is not visible, choose **Show Counters Panel** on the toolbar.  
  
3.  Expand the **Errors** and select either an error category, or an error sub-category that you want to analyze.  
  
4.  Right-click the error and select one of the following options:  
  
    -   **Show Counter on Graph**: In the Graphs view, the error is added and highlighted on the selected graph. For more information, see [How to: Add and Delete Counters on Graphs](../test/how-to--add-and-delete-counters-on-graphs-in-load-test-results.md).  
  
    -   **Show Counter on Legend**: The error is added and selected in the Legend. For more information, see [Using the Graphs View Legend to Analyze Load Tests](../test/using-the-graphs-view-legend-to-analyze-load-tests.md).  
  
    -   **Add Graph**:  
  
    1.  The **Enter Graph Name** dialog box is displayed.  
  
    2.  In the **Graph name** text box, type a name for the new graph and then choose **OK**.  
  
    3.  (Optional) Right-click the error again and select **Show Counter on Graph**.  
  
         For more information, see [How to: Create Custom Graphs](../test/how-to--create-custom-graphs-in-load-test-results.md).  
  
5.  (Optional) If you are analyzing an error in a completed load test result, consider using the zoom features while in the Graphs. For more information, see [How to: Zoom in on a Region of the Graph](../test/how-to--zoom-in-on-a-region-of-the-graph-in-load-test-results.md).  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  If any errors were detected during the load test run, a link titled errors including the number found will be present in the Load Test Analyzer status bar. You can choose the link to display all the errors in the **Errors** table of the Tables view.
