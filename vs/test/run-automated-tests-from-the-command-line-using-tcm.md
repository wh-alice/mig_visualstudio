# Run automated tests from the command line using tcm
You can run test cases with associated automation from the command line using tcm.exe instead of using the user interface provided by [!INCLUDE[TCMext](../codequality/includes/tcmext_md.md)]. This enables you to start runs automatically from a batch file. For example, you can then decide to schedule that batch file to run every time that a build is completed.  
  
 To run these automated test cases so that the test results are part of your test plan, you must use a lab environment. When you start the run from the command line, use tcm.exe. You must specify both the test settings that contain the set of roles that you require to run your tests, and an environment that contains this set of roles. For more information about test settings and environments, see [Setting Up Test Machines to Run Tests or Collect Data](../test/setting-up-test-machines-to-run-tests-or-collect-data.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you want to run automated tests that interact with the desktop, you must set up your agent to run as a process instead of a service. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Your Test Agent to Run Tests that Interact with the Desktop](../test/how-to--set-up-your-test-agent-to-run-tests-that-interact-with-the-desktop.md).  
  
 You can use a query to specify the test case and configuration pairing*,* which are named *test points,* or you can specify the test suites and configurations that you want to run from your test plan. You have to know the IDs for your test plan, your test suites, and configurations. You can use tcm.exe to list these for you if it is required.  
  
 Use the following procedures to gather the information that you have to have in order to run your automated tests from the command line and then run the tests:  
  
-   [List all the configurations in your team project](#ListConfigs)  
  
-   [List all the test plans in your team project](#ListPlans)  
  
-   [List all the test environments for your team project](#ListEnvironments)  
  
-   [List all the test suites in your test plan](#ListSuites)  
  
-   [Create a test run using a test point query](#CreateRunFromQuery)  
  
-   [Create a test run for a test suite and a specific configuration](#CreateRunForSuite)  
  
-   [View and update the test results](#ViewTest)  
  
## Common parameters for the procedures  
  
|**Parameter**|**Description**|  
|-------------------|---------------------|  
|**/collection**:`CollectionURL`|Specifies the URI of the team project collection. The format for the URI is as follows: **http**://*ServerName:Port/VirtualDirectoryName/CollectionName*<br /><br /> If no virtual directory is used, then the format for the URI is as follows:<br /><br /> **http**://*ServerName:Port/CollectionName*<br /><br /> If you do not know the correct path, contact your [!INCLUDE[esprfound](../codequality/includes/esprfound_md.md)] system administrator.|  
|**/teamproject:** *TeamProjectName*|The team project that you want to use. This team project must be defined in the project collection specified by the **/collection** parameter.|  
|**/login:** *UserName,Password*|Optional. Specifies the name and password of a user who is logged on to the application-tier server for [!INCLUDE[esprtfs](../codequality/includes/esprtfs_md.md)] and who has permissions to run the command.<br /><br /> You would use this option if your Windows credentials do not have the appropriate permissions, or you are using basic authentication, or you are not connected to a domain.<br /><br /> To login to Visual Studio Team Services, you will also need to use **/allowalternatecredentials** listed below.|  
|**/allowalternatecredentials**|This flag must be specified in addition to the **/login** parameter when connecting to Visual Studio Team Services. (This flag is only available if you have Visual Studio 2013 Update 4 or greater.)|  
|**/build**|Optional. Specifies the number of the build that will be associated with the test run. If the /buildDir option is not specified, the drop location of this build will be used to pick up test binaries.|  
|**/buildDefinition**|Name of the build definition that the build belongs to.|  
|**/flavor**|Flavor of the build to be used, in case the build has more than one.|  
|**/platform**|Platform of the Build to be used, in case the build has more than one.|  
|**/?** or **help**|Displays help about the command in the Command Prompt window.|
