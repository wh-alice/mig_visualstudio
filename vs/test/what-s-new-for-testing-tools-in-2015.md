# What&#39;s new for testing tools in 2015
Visual Studio now includes features for testers in these areas:  
  
-   [Generate unit tests for your code](../code-quality/generate-unit-tests-for-your-code-with-intellitest.md). Explore your .NET code to generate test data and a suite of unit tests. For every statement in the code, a test input is generated that will execute that statement.  
  
-   [Create unit tests for your code](../code-quality/unit-test-basics.md). Create a unit test project and unit test stubs from your code.  
  
-   [Run cloud-based load tests where your users are](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn250793%28v=vs.140%29.aspx) when you use Visual Studio Online. This generates load in an Azure datacenter that's closer to your users, reducing latency and simulating local conditions.  
  
-   [Run automated tests continuously with your builds](../test/run-tests-with-your-builds.md). Make sure that your app still works after changes are checked in and built.  
  
 See the [Team Foundation Server release notes](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/tfs2015-vs#loadtest) and [Visual Studio release notes](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2015-vs#Testing) for more details about whatâ€™s new.
