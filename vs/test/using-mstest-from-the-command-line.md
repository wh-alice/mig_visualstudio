# Using MSTest from the command line
You can use the MSTest.exe program to run automated tests in a test assembly from a command line. You can also view the test results from these test runs, save the results to disk, and save your results to [!INCLUDE[esprtfs](../code-quality/includes/esprtfs_md.md)].  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  MSTest is used to run load test in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../code-quality/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)]. By default, unit tests and coded UI tests use VSTest.Console.exe in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../code-quality/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)]. However, MSTest is used for compatibility with test projects created using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../code-quality/includes/vs2010_md.md)], or if a .testsettings file is manually added to a [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../code-quality/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)] solution containing a unit test project, or coded UI test project.  
  
 You can also use tcm.exe to run test cases with associated automation from the command line using a test environment.
