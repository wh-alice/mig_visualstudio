# Modifying Load Test Logging Settings
The load test result for the completed load test contains performance counter samples and error information that was collected in a log periodically from the computers-under-test. A large number of performance counter samples can be collected over the course of a load test run. The amount of performance data that is collected depends on the length of the run, the sampling interval, the number of computers under test, and the number of counters to collect. For a large load test, the amount of performance data that is collected can easily be several gigabytes; therefore, you might consider modifying how often data is saved to the log. See [Distributing Load Test Runs Across Multiple Test Machines Using Test Controllers and Test Agents](../test/6e67a587-8aad-48cc-a8c0-6d4b399f3731.md).  
  
 The *test controller* spools all collected load test sample data to a database log while the test is running. Additional data, such as timing details and error details, is loaded into the database when the test completes.
