# How to: Submit a Bug Using Microsoft Visual Studio
You can submit a bug using Visual Studio at any time during the software development process. For example, you perform ad hoc testing and find a bug, or you notice incorrect behavior while youâ€™re discussing the application under test with your team mates. You can manually attach information to this bug and link it to other work items.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Using Visual Studio to submit a bug does not automatically add data that was collected when a test was run, unlike when you create a bug using Test Runner or the Exploratory Testing window from Microsoft Test Manager. For more information about these methods, see [Submitting Bugs](../test_notintoc/submitting-bugs-in-microsoft-test-manager.md).
