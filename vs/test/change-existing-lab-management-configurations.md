# Change Existing Lab Management Configurations
After you have configured [!INCLUDE[vstsLabShort](../test/includes/vstslabshort_md.md)], you might want to change the resources that you are using for a team project collection. You might want to add more resources as you create more virtual machines, templates, and environments, or change the integration service account, or add a build controller or test controller.  
  
## Tasks  
 Use the following topics to help you change existing [!INCLUDE[vstsLabShort](../test/includes/vstslabshort_md.md)] configurations:
