# How to: Create Custom Graphs in Load Test Results
You can design graphs that display specific information about load test results. You design a custom graph by specifying the load test counters that the graph will display.  
  
 You can perform the following procedure either while a load test is running or after it has finished running.  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
-   Visual Studio Enterprise  
  
### To create a custom load test results graph  
  
1.  On the Load Test toolbar, choose **Add New Graph**.  
  
     \- or -  
  
     On the Load Test Analyzer, right-click in the Counters panel or in a graph, and then select **Add Graph**.  
  
     The **Enter Graph Name** dialog box is displayed.  
  
2.  Under **Graph name**, type a name for the graph, and choose **OK**.  
  
     The new graph appears in the Load Test Analyzer. It appears in the currently selected graph panel; it replaces the graph that was displayed in that panel.  
  
3.  Customize the new graph by adding counters. For more information, see [How to: Add and Delete Counters on Graphs](../test/how-to--add-and-delete-counters-on-graphs-in-load-test-results.md).
