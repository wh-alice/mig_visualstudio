>  You can also use the drop-down list on **Export Graph Data to Excel** button to select **Export Graph Data to Test (.csv)** to export to a comma separated text file.  
  
 If you are exporting the data with the intension of using it for reporting purposes, it is recommended that you use the built-in reporting functionality instead. For more information, see [Reporting Load Tests Results for Test Comparisons or Trend Analysis](../test/reporting-load-tests-results-for-test-comparisons-or-trend-analysis.md).
