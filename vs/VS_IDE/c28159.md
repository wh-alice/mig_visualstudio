# C28159
warning C28159: Consider using another function instead.  
  
 This warning is reported for Drivers is suggesting that you use a preferred function call that is semantically equivalent to the function that the driver is calling. This is a general warning message; the annotation `__drv_preferredFunction` was used (possibly with a conditional a `__drv_when`() annotation) to flag a bad coding practice.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example generates this warning:  
  
```  
char buff[MAX_PATH];  
  
OemToChar(buff, input);  
  
    // if strlen(input) > MAX_PATH  
....// leads to buffer overrun  
```  
  
 The following code example avoids this warning:  
  
```  
char buff[MAX_PATH];  
  
OemToCharBuff(buff, input, MAX_PATH);  
```
