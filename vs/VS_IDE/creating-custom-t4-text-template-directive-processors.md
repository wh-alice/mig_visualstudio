# Creating Custom T4 Text Template Directive Processors
The *text template transformation process* takes a *text template* file as the input and produces a text file as the output. The *text template transformation engine* controls the process, and the engine interacts with a text template transformation host and one or more text template *directive processors* to complete the process. For more information, see [The Text Template Transformation Process](../VS_IDE/the-text-template-transformation-process.md).  
  
 To create a custom directive processor, you create a class that inherits from either \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.DirectiveProcessor> or \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.RequiresProvidesDirectiveProcessor>.  
  
 The difference between these two is that \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.DirectiveProcessor> implements the minimum interface that is necessary to get parameters from the user and to generate the code that produces the template output file. \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.RequiresProvidesDirectiveProcessor> implements the requires/provides design pattern. \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.RequiresProvidesDirectiveProcessor> handles two special parameters, `requires` and `provides`.  For example, a custom directive processor might accept a file name from the user, open and read the file, and then store the text of the file in a variable that is named `fileText`. A subclass of the \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.RequiresProvidesDirectiveProcessor> class might take a file name from the user as the value of the `requires` parameter, and the name of the variable in which to store the text as the value of the `provides` parameter. This processor would open and read the file and then store the text of the file in the specified variable.  
  
 Before you call a custom directive processor from a text template in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], you must register it.  
  
 For more information about how to add the registry key, see [Deploying a Custom Directive Processor](../VS_IDE/deploying-a-custom-directive-processor.md).  
  
## Custom Directives  
 A custom directive looks like this:  
  
 `<#@ MyDirective Processor="MyDirectiveProcessor" parameter1="value1" â€¦ #>`  
  
 You can use a custom directive processor when you want to access external data or resources from a text template.  
  
 Different text templates can share the functionality that a single directive processor provides, so directive processors provide a way to factor code for reuse. The built-in `include` directive is similar, because you can use it to factor out code and share it among different text templates. The difference is that any functionality that the `include` directive provides is fixed and does not accept parameters. If you want to provide common functionality to a text template and allow the template to pass parameters, you must create a custom directive processor.  
  
 Some examples of custom directive processors could be:  
  
-   A directive processor to return data from a database that accepts a user name and password as parameters.  
  
-   A directive processor to open and read a file that accepts the name of the file as a parameter.  
  
### Principal parts of a custom directive processor  
 To develop a directive processor, you must create a class that inherits from either \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.DirectiveProcessor> or \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.RequiresProvidesDirectiveProcessor>.  
  
 The most important `DirectiveProcessor` methods that you must implement are as follows.  
  
-   `bool IsDirectiveSupported(string directiveName)` - Return `true` if your directive processor can deal with the named directive.  
  
-   `void ProcessDirective (string directiveName, IDictionary<string, string> arguments)` - The template engine calls this method for each occurrence of a directive in the template. Your processor should save the results.  
  
 After all calls to ProcessDirective() the templating engine will call these methods:  
  
-   `string[] GetReferencesForProcessingRun()` - Return the names of assemblies that the template code requires.  
  
-   `string[] GetImportsForProcessingRun()` - Return the namespaces that can be used in the template code.  
  
-   `string GetClassCodeForProcessingRun()` - Return the code of methods, properties, and other declarations that the template code can use. The easiest way to do this is to build a string containing the C# or Visual Basic code. To make your directive processor capable of being called from a template that uses any CLR language, you can construct the statements as a CodeDom tree and then return the result of serializing the tree in the language used by the template.
