# CA1031: Do not catch general exception types

## Cause  
 A general exception such as \<xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName> or \<xref:System.SystemException?displayProperty=fullName> is caught in a `catch` statement, or a general catch clause such as `catch()` is used.  
  
## Rule Description  
 General exceptions should not be caught.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, catch a more specific exception, or rethrow the general exception as the last statement in the `catch` block.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Catching general exception types can hide run-time problems from the library user and can make debugging more difficult.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../VS_IDE/includes/net_v40_long_md.md)], the common language runtime (CLR) no longer delivers corrupted state exceptions that occur in the operating system and managed code, such as access violations in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/tlasharptla_mswin_md.md)], to be handled by managed code. If you want to compile an application in the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../VS_debugger/includes/net_v40_short_md.md)] or later versions and maintain handling of corrupted state exceptions, you can apply the \<xref:System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptionsAttribute> attribute to the method that handles the corrupted state exception.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows a type that violates this rule and a type that correctly implements the `catch` block.
