# Overviews (Performance Tools)
This section provides conceptual and terminology overviews for [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools, which you can use to measure the performance characteristics of an application under development.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Performance Session Overview](../VS_IDE/performance-session-overview.md)  
 Learn the basics of performance profiling with the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools.  
  
 [Performance Session Properties](../VS_IDE/performance-session-properties.md)  
 Describes the properties that can be used to configure a performance session.  
  
 [Understanding Sampling Data Values](../VS_IDE/understanding-sampling-data-values.md)  
 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the sampling profiling method.  
  
 [Understanding Instrumentation Data Values](../VS_IDE/understanding-instrumentation-data-values.md)  
 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the instrumentation profiling method.  
  
 [Understanding Memory Allocation and Object Lifetime Data Values](../VS_IDE/understanding-memory-allocation-and-object-lifetime-data-values.md)  
 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the .NET memory profiling method.  
  
 [Understanding Resource Contention Data Values](../VS_IDE/understanding-resource-contention-data-values.md)  
 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the concurrency profiling method.  
  
 [Performance Explorer Window](../VS_IDE/performance-explorer-window.md)  
 Describes the window that is used to configure and start performance sessions.  
  
 [CPU and Windows Counters](../VS_IDE/cpu-and-windows-counters.md)  
 Learn about the CPU and Windows performance counters that can provide additional performance data in a performance session.  
  
 [Profiling and Windows Vista Security](../VS_IDE/profiling-and-windows-vista-security.md)  
 Learn the issues and steps that are required to collect sampling data and to profile cross-session applications on [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)].
