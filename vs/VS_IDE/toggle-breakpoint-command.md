# Toggle Breakpoint Command
Turns the breakpoint either on or off, depending on its current state, at the current location in the file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Debug.ToggleBreakpoint [text]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `text`  
 Optional. If text is specified, the line is marked as a named breakpoint. Otherwise, the line is marked as an unnamed breakpoint, which is similar to what happens when you press F9.  
  
## Example  
 The following example toggles the current breakpoint.  
  
```  
>Debug.ToggleBreakpoint  
```
