# Advanced Build Settings Dialog Box (C#)
Use the **AdvancedBuild Settings** dialog box of the **Project Designer** to specify the project's advanced build configuration properties. This dialog box applies to [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../VS_debugger/includes/csprcs_md.md)] projects only.  
  
## General  
 The following options enable you to set general advanced settings.  
  
 **Language Version**  
 Specifies the version of the language to use. The feature set is different in each version, so this option can be used to force the compiler to allow only a subset of the implemented features, or to enable only those features compatible with an existing standard. This setting has the following options:  
  
-   **ISO-1**  
  
     Targets the ISO-1 standard features.  
  
-   **default**  
  
     Targets the current version.  
  
 For more information, see [/langversion (C# Compiler Options)](../Topic/-langversion%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md).  
  
 **Internal Compiler Error Reporting**  
 Specifies whether to report compiler errors to Microsoft. If set to **prompt** (the default), you will receive a prompt if an internal compiler error occurs, giving you the option of sending an error report electronically to Microsoft. If set to **send**, an error report will be sent automatically. If set to **queue**, error reports will be queued. If set to **none**, the error will be reported only in the compiler's text output. For more information, see [/errorreport (C# Compiler Options)](../Topic/-errorreport%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md).  
  
 **Check for arithmetic overflow/underflow**  
 Specifies whether an integer arithmetic statement that is not in the scope of the [checked](../Topic/checked%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md) or [unchecked](../Topic/unchecked%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md) keywords and that results in a value outside the range of the data type will cause a run-time exception.For more information, see [/checked (C# Compiler Options)](../Topic/-checked%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md).  
  
 **Do not reference mscorlib.dll**  
 Specifies whether mscorlib.dll will be imported into your program, defining the entire \<xref:System> namespace. Check this box if you want to define or create your own \<xref:System> namespace and objects. For more information, see [/nostdlib (C# Compiler Options)](../Topic/-nostdlib%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md).  
  
## Output  
 The following options enable you to specify advanced output options.  
  
 **Debug Info**  
 Specifies the type of debugging information generated by the compiler. For information on how to configure the debug performance of an application, see [Making an Image Easier to Debug](../Topic/Making%20an%20Image%20Easier%20to%20Debug.md). This setting has the following options:  
  
-   **none**  
  
     Specifies that no debugging information will be generated  
  
-   **full**  
  
     Enables attaching a debugger to the running program.  
  
-   **pdbonly**  
  
     Allows source code debugging when the program is started in the debugger but will only display assembler when the running program is attached to the debugger.  
  
 For more information, see [/debug (C# Compiler Options)](../Topic/-debug%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md).  
  
 **File Alignment**  
 Specifies the size of sections in the output file. Valid values are **512**, **1024**, **2048**, **4096**, and **8192**. These values are measured in bytes. Each section will be aligned on a boundary that is a multiple of this value, affecting the size of the output file. For more information, see [/filealign (C# Compiler Options)](../Topic/-filealign%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md).  
  
 **DLL Base Address**  
 Specifies the preferred base address at which to load a DLL. The default base address for a DLL is set by the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../VS_debugger/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] common language runtime. For more information, see [/baseaddress (C# Compiler Options)](../Topic/-baseaddress%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md).
