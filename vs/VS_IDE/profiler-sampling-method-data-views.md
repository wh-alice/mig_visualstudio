# Profiler Sampling Method Data Views
This section contains reference information for the views and reports of profiler data files that were generated by using the sampling method.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Enhanced security features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 required significant changes in the way the Visual Studio profiler collects data on these platforms. Windows Store apps also require new collection techniques. See [Performance Tools on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../VS_IDE/performance-tools-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012-applications.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Summary View](../VS_IDE/summary-view---sampling-data.md)  
 Lists the functions that were executing most frequently when samples were collected and the functions that were performing the most individual work.  
  
 [Call Tree View](../VS_IDE/call-tree-view---sampling-data.md)  
 Displays the execution paths of functions in a hierarchical tree.  
  
 [Modules View](../VS_IDE/modules-view---sampling-data.md)  
 Organizes profiling data by module, and lists the functions, source code lines, and instructions that were executing when samples were collected.  
  
 [Caller / Callee View - Sampling Data](../VS_IDE/caller---callee-view---sampling-data.md)  
 Displays profiling data for a selected function and the functions that called and were called by the selected function.  
  
 [Functions View](../VS_IDE/functions-view---sampling-data.md)  
 Organizes profiling by function, and lists the functions that were executing when samples were collected.  
  
 [Lines View](../VS_IDE/lines-view---sampling-data.md)  
 Lists the source code lines that were executing when samples were collected.  
  
 [Instruction Pointers (IPs) View](../VS_IDE/instruction-pointers--ips--view---sampling-data.md)  
 Lists the source code lines that were executing when samples were collected.  
  
## Reference  
 [Process View](../VS_IDE/process-view.md)  
 Lists process and thread start and end times.  
  
 [Marks View](../VS_IDE/marks-view.md)  
 Lists ETW and sampling events that were inserted into a profiling data file.  
  
 [Function Details View](../VS_IDE/function-details-view.md)  
 Displays a graphical chart of the relationship between a selected function and the functions that called and were called by the selected function.
