# Working with Domain-Specific Language Solutions
A domain-specific language (DSL) is created using a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] solution. This section is about how to set up and customize the solution.  
  
## In this Section  
 [About Domain-Specific Languages](../VS_IDE/about-domain-specific-languages.md)  
 Discusses how to develop DSLs and how to apply them.  
  
 [Overview of Domain-Specific Language Tools](../VS_IDE/overview-of-domain-specific-language-tools.md)  
 Explains the major tasks in developing and distributing a DSL.  
  
 [Overview of the Domain-Specific Language Tools User Interface](../VS_IDE/overview-of-the-domain-specific-language-tools-user-interface.md)  
 Describes the windows that are associated with DSLs.  
  
 [Choosing a Domain-Specific Language Solution Template](../VS_IDE/choosing-a-domain-specific-language-solution-template.md)  
 Explains how to choose a template to start your DSL project.  
  
 [How to: Create a Domain-Specific Language Solution](../VS_IDE/how-to--create-a-domain-specific-language-solution.md)  
 Describes the steps to set up a DSL.  
  
 [Working with the DSL Definition Diagram](../VS_IDE/working-with-the-dsl-definition-diagram.md)  
 Explains the parts of the diagram.  
  
 [Working with the Domain-Specific Language Explorer](../VS_IDE/working-with-the-domain-specific-language-explorer.md)  
 Explains the content of the explorer  
  
 [How to: Change the Namespace of a Domain-Specific Language](../VS_IDE/how-to--change-the-namespace-of-a-domain-specific-language.md)  
 The code you generate from a DSL has a namespace that you set when you initiate your solution, but you can change it afterwards.  
  
 [How to: Extend the Domain-Specific Language Designer](../VS_IDE/how-to--extend-the-domain-specific-language-designer.md)  
 You can customize the DSL Designer with menu commands.  
  
 [How to Automate Transform All Templates](assetId:///b63cfe20-fe5e-47cc-9506-59b29bca768a)  
 To avoid clicking Transform All Templates, you can make it an automatic part of the build.
