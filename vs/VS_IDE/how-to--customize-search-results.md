# How to: Customize Search Results
You can customize how search results appear in the **Search** tab in several ways.

#### To change the number of topics displayed at a time

     The **Viewer Options** dialog box appears.  
  
2.  In the **Maximum Search Results** list, choose 25, 50, 100, or 200.  
  
## Search for content by language  
 Documentation may include content in a language other than English. You can narrow your search results to content in a particular language. You can also include any content in English that matches your search query.
