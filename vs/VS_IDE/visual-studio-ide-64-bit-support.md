# Visual Studio IDE 64-Bit Support
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] enables you to set up your applications to target different platforms, including 64-bit platforms. For more information on 64-bit platform support in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], see [64-bit Applications](../Topic/64-bit%20Applications.md).  
  
## Deploying a 64-bit application  
 The following topics discuss deploying 64-bit applications.  
  
-   [Deploying Prerequisites for 64-bit Applications](../VS_IDE/deploying-prerequisites-for-64-bit-applications.md)  
  
-   [How to: Create a Windows Installer for a 64-bit Platform](assetId:///232bfc64-f99a-4cc6-9806-ba70bb9a09ff)  
  
## Configuring projects as 64-bit applications  
 The following topics discuss configuring projects to be built to 64-bit applications.  
  
-   [How to: Configure Projects to Target Platforms](../VS_IDE/how-to--configure-projects-to-target-platforms.md)  
  
## Debugging a 64-bit application  
 Edit and Continue does not work when [!INCLUDE[vsprvslong](../VS_debugger/includes/vsprvslong_md.md)] is running on a 64-bit Windows operating system. The following topics discuss debugging 64-bit applications.
