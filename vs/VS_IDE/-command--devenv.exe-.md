# /Command (devenv.exe)
Executes the specified command after launching the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
devenv /command CommandName  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `CommandName`  
 Required. The complete name of a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] command or its alias, enclosed in double quotation marks. For more information about command and alias syntax, see [Visual Studio Commands](../VS_IDE/visual-studio-commands.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 After startup is complete, the IDE executes the named command. If you use this switch, the IDE does not display the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Start Page on startup.  
  
 If an add-in exposes a command, you can use this switch to launch the add-in from the command line. For more information, see [How to: Control Add-Ins By Using the Add-In Manager](../Topic/How%20to:%20Control%20Add-Ins%20By%20Using%20the%20Add-In%20Manager.md).  
  
## Example  
 This example launches [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and automatically runs the macro Open Favorite Files.  
  
```  
devenv /command "Macros.MyMacros.Module1.OpenFavoriteFiles"  
```
