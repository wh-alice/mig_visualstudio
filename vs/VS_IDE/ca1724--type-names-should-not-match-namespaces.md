## Cause  
 A type name matches a [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../VS_debugger/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] namespace names in a case-insensitive comparison.  
  
## Rule Description  
 Type names should not match the names of namespaces that are defined in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../VS_debugger/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] class library. Violating this rule can reduce the usability of the library.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 Select a type name that does not match the name of a [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../VS_debugger/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] class library namespace.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 For new development, no known scenarios occur where you must suppress a warning from this rule. Before you suppress the warning, carefully consider how the users of your library might be confused by the matching name. For shipping libraries, you might have to suppress a warning from this rule.
