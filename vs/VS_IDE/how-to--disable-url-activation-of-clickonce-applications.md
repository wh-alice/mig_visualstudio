# How to: Disable URL Activation of ClickOnce Applications
Typically, a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../VS_IDE/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] application will launch automatically immediately after it is installed from a Web server. For security reasons, you may decide to disable this behavior, and tell users to launch the application from the **Start** menu instead. The following procedure describes how to disable URL activation.  
  
 This technique can be used only for [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../VS_IDE/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] applications installed on the user's computer from a Web server. It cannot be used for online-only applications, which can be launched only by using their URL. For more information on the difference between online-only and installed applications, see [Choosing a ClickOnce Deployment Strategy](../VS_IDE/choosing-a-clickonce-deployment-strategy.md).  
  
 This procedure uses the [!INCLUDE[winsdklong](../VS_IDE/includes/winsdklong_md.md)] tool MageUI.exe. For more information on this tool, see [MageUI.exe (Manifest Generation and Editing Tool, Graphical Client)](../Topic/MageUI.exe%20\(Manifest%20Generation%20and%20Editing%20Tool,%20Graphical%20Client\).md). You can also perform this procedure using [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  
  
## Procedure  
  
#### To disable URL activation for your application  
  
1.  Open your deployment manifest in MageUI.exe. If you have not yet created one, follow the steps in [Walkthrough: Manually Deploying a ClickOnce Application](../VS_IDE/walkthrough--manually-deploying-a-clickonce-application.md).  
  
2.  Select the **Deployment Options** tab.  
  
3.  Clear the **Automatically run application after installing** check box.  
  
4.  Save and sign the manifest.
