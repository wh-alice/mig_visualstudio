# How to: Instrument a Stand-Alone .NET Framework Component and Collect Timing Data with the Profiler from the Command Line
This topic describes how to use [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools command-line tools to instrument a .NET Framework component such as an .exe or .dll file, and to collect detailed timing data.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Enhanced security features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 required significant changes in the way the Visual Studio profiler collects data on these platforms. Windows Store apps also require new collection techniques. See [Performance Tools on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../VS_IDE/performance-tools-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012-applications.md).  
>   
>  Command-line tools of the Profiling Tools are located in the \Team Tools\Performance Tools subdirectory of the [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../VS_debugger/includes/vs_current_short_md.md)] installation directory. On 64-bit computers, both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of the tools are available. To use the profiler command-line tools, you must add the tools path to the PATH environment variable of the Command Prompt window or add it to the command itself. For more information, see [Specifying the Path to Command Line Tools](../VS_IDE/specifying-the-path-to-profiling-tools-command-line-tools.md).  
>   
>  Adding tier interaction data to a profiling run requires specific procedures with the command line profiling tools. See [Collecting tier interaction data](../VS_IDE/adding-tier-interaction-data-from-the-command-line.md).  
  
 To collect detailed timing data from a .NET Framework component by using the instrumentation method, you use the [VSInstr.exe](../VS_IDE/vsinstr.md) tool to generate an instrumented version of the component and the [VSPerfCLREnv.cmd](../VS_IDE/vsperfclrenv.md) tool to initialize profiling environment variables. You then start the profiler.  
  
 When the instrumented component is executed, timing data is automatically collected to a data file. You can pause and resume data collection during the profiling session.  
  
 To end a profiling session, you close the target application and explicitly shut down the profiler. In most cases, we recommend clearing the profiling environment variables at the end of a session.  
  
## Starting the Profiling Session  
  
#### To start profiling by using the instrumentation method  
  
1.  Open a Command Prompt window. If necessary, add the profiler tools directory to your PATH environment variable. The path is not added at installation.  
  
2.  Use the **VSInstr** tool to generate an instrumented version of the target application.  
  
3.  Initialize the .NET Framework profiling environment variables. Type:  
  
     **VSPerfClrEnv /traceon**  
  
4.  Start the profiler. Type:  
  
     **VSPerfCmd /start:trace /output:** `OutputFile` [`Options`]  
  
    -   The [/start](../VS_IDE/start.md)**:trace** option initializes the profiler.  
  
    -   The [/output](../VS_IDE/output.md)**:**`OutputFile` option is required with **/start**. `OutputFile` specifies the name and location of the profiling data (.vsp) file.  
  
     You can use any one of the following options with the **/start:trace** option.  
  
    |Option|Description|  
    |------------|-----------------|  
    |[/user](../VS_IDE/user--vsperfcmd-.md) **:**[`Domain`**\\**]`UserName`|Specifies the domain and user name of the account that owns the profiled process. This option is required only if the process is running as a user other than the logged-on user. The process owner is listed in the User Name column on the Processes tab of Windows Task Manager.|  
    |[/crosssession](../VS_IDE/crosssession.md)|Enables profiling of processes in other sessions. This option is required if the ASP.NET application is running in a different session. The session idenitifier is listed in the Session ID column on the Processes tab of Windows Task Manager. **/CS** can be specified as an abbreviation for **/crosssession**.|  
    |[/globaloff](../VS_IDE/globalon-and-globaloff.md)|Starts the profiler with data collection paused. Use [/globalon](../VS_IDE/globalon-and-globaloff.md) to resume profiling.|  
    |[/counter](../VS_IDE/counter.md) **:** `Config`|Collects information from the processor performance counter that is specified in `Config`. Counter information is added to the data that is collected at each profiling event.|  
    |[/wincounter](../VS_IDE/wincounter.md) **:** `WinCounterPath`|Specifies a Windows performance counter to be collected during profiling.|  
    |[/automark](../VS_IDE/automark.md) **:** `Interval`|Use with **/wincounter** only. Specifies the number of milliseconds between Windows performance counter collection events. Default is 500 ms.|  
    |[/events](../VS_IDE/events--vsperfcmd-.md) **:** `Config`|Specifies an Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) event to be collected during profiling. ETW events are collected in a separate (.etl) file.|  
  
5.  Start the target application from the Command Prompt window.  
  
## Controlling Data Collection  
 When the target application is running, you can control data collection by starting and stopping the writing of data to the profiler data file by using **VSPerfCmd.exe** options. Controlling data collection enables you to collect data for a specific part of program execution, such as starting or shutting down the application.  
  
#### To start and stop data collection  
  
-   The following pairs of options start and stop data collection. Specify each option on a separate command line. You can turn data collection on and off multiple times.  
  
    |Option|Description|  
    |------------|-----------------|  
    |[/globalon /globaloff](../VS_IDE/globalon-and-globaloff.md)|Starts (**/globalon**) or stops (**/globaloff**) data collection for all processes.|  
    |[/processon](../VS_IDE/processon-and-processoff.md) **:** `PID` [/processoff](../VS_IDE/processon-and-processoff.md) **:** `PID`|Starts (**/processon**) or stops (**/processoff**) data collection for the process specified by the process ID (`PID`).|  
    |[/threadon](../VS_IDE/threadon-and-threadoff.md) **:** `TID` [/threadoff](../VS_IDE/threadon-and-threadoff.md) **:** `TID`|Starts (**/threadon**) or stops (**/threadoff**) data collection for the thread specified by the thread ID (`TID`).|  
  
## Ending the Profiling Session  
 To end a profiling session, close the application that is running the instrumented component. Call the **VSPerfCmd** [/shutdown](../VS_IDE/shutdown.md) option to turn off the profiler and close the profiling data file. The **VSPerfClrEnv /off** command clears the profiling environment variables.  
  
#### To end a profiling session  
  
1.  Close the target application.  
  
2.  Shut down the profiler. Type:  
  
     **VSPerfCmd /shutdown**  
  
3.  (Optional) Clear the profiling environment variables. Type:  
  
     **VSPerfClrEnv /off**
