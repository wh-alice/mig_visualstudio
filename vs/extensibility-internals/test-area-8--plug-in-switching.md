# Test Area 8: Plug-in Switching
The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE) has the user interface (UI) to change the current source control plug-in. This test area provides test cases for the process of picking which plug-in to use for solution source control.  
  
## Command Menu Access  
 The following [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment menu paths are used in the test cases.  
  
-   Current source control plug-in: **Tools** -> **Options** -> **Source Control** -> **Plug-in Selection**.  
  
-   Change source control binding: **File** -> **Source Control** -> **Change Source Control**â€¦  
  
## Common Expected Behavior  
 Changing the source control plug-in for a solution is possible without exiting Visual Studio or reloading the solution. In addition, the current source control plug-in automatically changes to the one used by a solution when that solution is loaded.  
  
## Test Cases  
 The following are specific test cases for the plug-in switching test area.  
  
### Case 8a: Automatic Change  
  
#### Expected Behavior  
 When a user loads  a solution that is under source control, the solution is automatically loaded and the appropriate source control plug-in is selected as current.  
  
|Action|Test Steps|Expected Results to Verify|  
|------------|----------------|--------------------------------|  
|Automatic source control plug-in change|1.  Select plug-in under test as current (**Tools** -> **Options** -> **Source Control** -> **Plug-in Selection**.)<br />2.  Create a new project.<br />3.  Add the solution to source control.<br />4.  Select another plug-in (for example, [!INCLUDE[vsvss](../extensibility/includes/vsvss_md.md)]).<br />5.  Accept unloading solution prompt.<br />6.  Reopen the solution from disk.|Solution is opened.<br /><br /> Plug-in under test is the current source control plug-in.|  
  
### Case 8b: Solution-based Change  
  
#### Expected Behavior  
 The solution can have its associated source control plug-in changed.  
  
|Action|Test Steps|Expected Results to Verify|  
|------------|----------------|--------------------------------|  
|Change of plug-in for a solution|1.  Select plug-in under test as current (**Tools** -> **Options** -> **Source Control** -> **Plug-in Selection**).<br />2.  Create a new project and solution.<br />3.  Add the solution to source control.<br />4.  Unbind the solution from source control (using the **Change Source Control** dialog box).<br />5.  Select another plug-in (for example, [!INCLUDE[vsvss](../extensibility/includes/vsvss_md.md)]).<br />6.  Reload the solution from disk if unloaded.<br />7.  Add the solution to source control.<br />8.  Unbind the solution from source control (using **Change Source Control** dialog box).<br />9. Select plug-in under test again.<br />10. Reload solution from disk if unloaded.<br />11. Bind the solution to the original location (using the **Change Source Control** dialog box).|Solution is added to source control by using the selected plug-in.|
