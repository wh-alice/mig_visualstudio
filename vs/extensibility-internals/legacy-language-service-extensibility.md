# Legacy Language Service Extensibility
A language service provides language-specific support for editing source code in the IDE.  
  
 Legacy language services are implemented as part of a VSPackage, but the newer way to implement language service features is to use MEF extensions. To find out more about the new way to implement a language service, see [Editor and Language Service Extensions](../extensibility/editor-and-language-service-extensions.md).  
  
 This section discusses the structure and implementation of a legacy language service.
