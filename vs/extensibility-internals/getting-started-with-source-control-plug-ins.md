# Getting Started with Source Control Plug-ins
To create a source control plug-in, you must create a DLL that implements the functions defined in the Source Control Plug-in API, and then to register the DLL with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] to make it available for use in source code version control.  
  
 Three versions of the Source Control Plug-in API (versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) are available for source control plug-ins. The Source Control Plug-in API documented here is version 1.3. It was designed to be fully compatible with source control plug-ins supporting versions 1.1 and 1.2. The [What's New in the Source Control Plug-in API Version 1.3](../extensibility-internals/what-s-new-in-the-source-control-plug-in-api-version-1.3.md) section details the new features supported in the latest version of the Source Control Plug-in API.
