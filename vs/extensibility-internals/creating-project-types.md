# Creating Project Types
You can extend [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] by creating a new project type. To create a new project type, you must understand several concepts and complete a number of steps. The following topics provide an overview of how to create project types.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Project Type Design Decisions](../extensibility-internals/project-type-design-decisions.md)  
 Discusses the item, project file persistence, and commitment mechanic design decisions that you have to make before creating a new project type.  
  
 [Checklist: Creating New Project Types](../extensibility-internals/checklist--creating-new-project-types.md)  
 Provides an overview of the steps that you must follow to create a new project type that supports programming tasks as editing code and compiling, building, debugging, and deploying applications in your project.  
  
 [Creating Project Instances By Using Project Factories](../extensibility-internals/creating-project-instances-by-using-project-factories.md)  
 Provides information about how to provide and use a project factory to create instances of a new project.  
  
 [Registering a Project Type](../extensibility-internals/registering-a-project-type.md)  
 Provides code samples of statements from the registry that provide default paths and data, and a table that contain entries from the registry script for each statement.  
  
 [Project Persistence](../extensibility-internals/project-persistence.md)  
 Discusses the use of `IPersistFileFormat` to persist both file and non-file-based project objects.  
  
 [Using MSBuild](../extensibility-internals/using-msbuild.md)  
 Describes how your project type can use the [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../extensibility-internals/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)] build engine to let users build from [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and at the command line.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Supporting Symbol-Browsing Tools](../extensibility-internals/supporting-symbol-browsing-tools.md)  
 Explains the architecture of code viewing tools such as the **Object Browser** and **Class View** window. Describes the interfaces and methods that are used to implement object browsing in a VSPackage.  
  
 [Adding Project and Project Item Templates](../extensibility-internals/adding-project-and-project-item-templates.md)  
 Discusses the significance that projects play in determining which editor is used when a project item is opened and how project resources can be manipulated.  
  
 [Installing VSPackages With Windows Installer](../extensibility-internals/installing-vspackages-with-windows-installer.md)  
 Shows how to give your VSPackage its own unique identity and how to wrap your VSPackage DLLs and other information in a Windows Installer package (.MSI file) for deployment to your customers.  
  
 [Hierarchies in Visual Studio](../extensibility-internals/hierarchies-in-visual-studio.md)  
 Describes how [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] views and addresses hierarchies.  
  
 [VSPackages](../extensibility-internals/vspackages.md)  
 Provides an overview of a VSPackage, an installable COM object that extends the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] environment and discusses how to implement your own VSPackage.  
  
 [Project Types](../extensibility-internals/project-types.md)  
 Discusses how to use projects to modify code, compile and build code, and run and debug code, and provides links to detailed topics about how to create project types.
