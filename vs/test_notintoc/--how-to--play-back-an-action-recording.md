# - How to: Play Back an Action Recording
After you create an *action recording*, you can play it back while you run a test that contains the recording. This helps in circumstances where you might have to run the test multiple times because the action recording automatically plays back the steps. Alternatively, you can fast forward through the test steps until you reach the correct test step to verify a bug.  
  
 For information about how to create an action recording, see [- How to: Create an Action Recording](../test_notintoc/--how-to--create-an-action-recording.md).  
  
 The action recording can also contain data that the tests steps use while the test runs, for example, logging on to an application or a Web site. As soon as the action recording finishes, you can continue to test manually at the point where the action recording stopped.  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
-   Visual Studio Enterprise, [!INCLUDE[vstsTestEssLong](../test/includes/vststestesslong_md.md)]  
  
 The following procedure describes how to play back an action recording, starting with how to load a test into Test Runner.  
  
## Replay an Action Recording from a Test Case in Microsoft Test Manager in Test Runner  
 To play an action recording, you must first load a test that contains an action recording into [!INCLUDE[mtrshort](../test_notintoc/includes/mtrshort_md.md)] from [!INCLUDE[TCMext](../code-quality/includes/tcmext_md.md)]. For more information, see [- How to: Create an Action Recording](../test_notintoc/--how-to--create-an-action-recording.md).  
  
 **Loading a test with an action recording**

#### To load a test into Test Runner  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[TCMext](../code-quality/includes/tcmext_md.md)].  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  To display the [!INCLUDE[TCMext](../code-quality/includes/tcmext_md.md)] window, choose Start, All Programs, Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft Test Manager.

5.  In the left side pane, under **RunTests**, select either the test plan or the test suite listed under the test plan that contains the test that you want to run.  
  
     The right side pane displays the test cases within the selected test suite.  
  
6.  In the right side pane, choose a test case that contains an action recording and then choose **Run**.  
  
     The **Test Runner** opens.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Select **Run with options** to specify a build to run the test on, or to override the test settings and environment settings for the test plan. For more information, see [How to: Override Settings in Your Test Plan for Test Runs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/832576d2-44bd-4237-8cde-612349a3ab50).

#### To replay an action recording from the test loaded from Microsoft Test Manager  
  
1.  When you load a test from [!INCLUDE[TCMext](../code-quality/includes/tcmext_md.md)] into [!INCLUDE[mtrshort](../test_notintoc/includes/mtrshort_md.md)], you are prompted to **Start Test** with the option **Create action recording**. Leave **Create action recording** clear and choose **Start Test**.
