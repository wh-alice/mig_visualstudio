# How to: Connect to Data in a Service
You connect your application to the data returned from a service by running the [Data Source Configuration Wizard](../VS_raddata/media/data-source-configuration-wizard.png) and selecting **Service** on the **Choose a Data Source Type** page.  
  
 Upon completion of the wizard, a service reference is added to your project and is immediately available in the [Data Sources Window](../Topic/Data%20Sources%20Window.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The items that appear in the **Data Sources** window are dependent on the information that the service returns. Some services might not provide enough information for the **Data Source Configuration Wizard** to create bindable objects. For example, if the service returns an untyped dataset, then no items appear in the **Data Sources Window** upon completing the wizard. This is because untyped datasets do not provide schema, so the wizard does not have enough information to create the data source.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../VS_debugger/includes/note_settings_general_md.md)]  
  
### To connect your application to a service  
  
1.  On the **Data** menu, click **Add New Data Source**.  
  
2.  Select **Service** on the **Choose a Data Source Type** page, and then click **Next**.  
  
3.  Enter the address of the service you want to use, or click **Discover** to locate services in the current solution, and then click **Go**.  
  
4.  Optionally, a new **Namespace** can be typed in place of the default value.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Click **Advanced** to open the [Configure Service Reference Dialog Box](../VS_raddata/configure-service-reference-dialog-box.md).  
  
5.  Click **OK** to add a service reference to your project.  
  
6.  Click **Finish**.  
  
     The data source is added to the **Data Sources** window.  
  
## Next Steps  
  
#### To add functionality to your application  
  
-   Select an item in the **Data Sources** window and drag it onto a form to create bound controls. For more information, see [Bind controls to data in Visual Studio](../VS_raddata/bind-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio.md).
