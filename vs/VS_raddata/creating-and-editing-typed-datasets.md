# Creating and Editing Typed Datasets
The**Dataset Designer** is a set of visual tools that you can use to create and edit typed datasets and the individual items that they contain.  
  
 The **Dataset Designer** provides visual representations of the objects contained in typed datasets. You create and modify [TableAdapters](../VS_raddata/tableadapter-overview.md), [TableAdapter Queries](../VS_raddata/how-to--create-tableadapter-queries.md), \<xref:System.Data.DataTable>s, \<xref:System.Data.DataColumn>s, and \<xref:System.Data.DataRelation>s with the **Dataset Designer**.  
  
 To open the **Dataset Designer**, double-click a dataset in **Solution Explorer**, or right-click a dataset in the **Data Sources** window and click **Edit DataSet with Designer**. For more information, see [How to: Open a Dataset in the Dataset Designer](../Topic/How%20to:%20Open%20a%20Dataset%20in%20the%20Dataset%20Designer.md). Adding a new \<xref:System.Data.DataSet> item with the **Add New Item** dialog box will open the **Dataset Designer** with an empty dataset ready for editing.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The **Dataset Designer** can be used to extend the functionality of a dataset. Double-click the design surface or right-click and choose **View Code** to create a partial class file where you can add code to the dataset that will not be changed or deleted by the designer. For information on extending the functionality of a TableAdapter, see [Extend the functionality of a TableAdapter](../VS_raddata/extend-the-functionality-of-a-tableadapter.md).  
  
 The following table lists the common tasks you can accomplish with the **Dataset Designer**.

## Creating Objects on the Design Surface  
 You can create datasets by adding and editing the individual objects that make up a dataset. The following table provides an explanation of the different objects in the **DataSet** tab on the **Toolbox** that can be dragged onto the design surface:  
  
|Object|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|TableAdapter|Contains a collection of data commands and a data connection that are used to communicate with the underlying database and populate a data table. For more information, see [TableAdapter Overview](../VS_raddata/tableadapter-overview.md) and [Create and configure TableAdapters](../VS_raddata/create-and-configure-tableadapters.md).|  
|Query|TableAdapter queries are strongly typed methods that execute SQL statements and stored procedures. Running a TableAdapter query populates a data table with data or performs other database tasks. For more information, see [How to: Create TableAdapter Queries](../VS_raddata/how-to--create-tableadapter-queries.md). Dragging a query onto a table adds the query to that table, whereas dragging a query onto an empty area of the **Dataset Designer** creates a global query. For more information, see [How to: Add Global Queries to a TableAdapter](../VS_raddata/how-to--add-global-queries-to-a-tableadapter.md).|  
|\<xref:System.Data.DataTable>|Represents an in-memory collection of the rows returned from a database.|  
|Relation (\<xref:System.Data.DataRelation>)|Represents a parent-child relationship between two \<xref:System.Data.DataTable>s. For more information, see [Introduction to DataRelation Objects](../Topic/Introduction%20to%20DataRelation%20Objects.md) and [Walkthrough: Creating a Relationship between Data Tables](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Creating%20a%20Relationship%20between%20Data%20Tables.md).|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The **Dataset Designer** connects to an underlying database only when a dataset is created; the designer doesn't automatically detect subsequent changes to the database. To refresh an existing .xsd, re-run the **Configuration Wizard**. If the table relations have changed, remove and re-add the relevant tables to the .xsd.  
  
## LINQ to Dataset  
 [!INCLUDE[linq_dataset](../VS_raddata/includes/linq_dataset_md.md)] enables [LINQ (Language-Integrated Query)](../Topic/LINQ%20\(Language-Integrated%20Query\).md) over data in a \<xref:System.Data.DataSet> object. For more information, see [LINQ to DataSet](../Topic/LINQ%20to%20DataSet.md).
