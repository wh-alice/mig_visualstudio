# Designing DataTables
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] provides design-time tools for creating and editing data tables (**DataTable**). For an overview of what a **DataTable** is, see [DataTables](../Topic/DataTables.md).  
  
 The following topics explain how to create data tables, add them to typed datasets using the **Dataset Designer**, and create and edit the data columns (**DataColumn**) that define them.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](assetId:///22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
## In This Section  
 [How to: Create Data Tables](../VS_raddata/how-to--create-data-tables.md)  
 Provides the steps to create a new \<xref:System.Data.DataTable> with the **Dataset Designer**.  
  
 [How to: Add Columns to a DataTable](../Topic/How%20to:%20Add%20Columns%20to%20a%20DataTable.md)  
 Provides the steps to create a new \<xref:System.Data.DataColumn> in an existing \<xref:System.Data.DataTable>.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Creating a DataTable in the Dataset Designer](../VS_raddata/walkthrough--creating-a-datatable-in-the-dataset-designer.md)  
 Provides step-by-step instructions for creating a \<xref:System.Data.DataTable> and defining the \<xref:System.Data.DataColumn>s that make up its structure.  
  
## Reference  
 \<xref:System.Data.DataSet>  
 Represents an in-memory cache of data.  
  
 \<xref:System.Data.DataTable>  
 Represents one table of in-memory data.  
  
 \<xref:System.Data.DataColumn>  
 Represents the schema of a column in a \<xref:System.Data.DataTable>.  
  
 \<xref:System.Data.DataRelation>  
 Represents a parent/child relationship between two \<xref:System.Data.DataTable> objects.
