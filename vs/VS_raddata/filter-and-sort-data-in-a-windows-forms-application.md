# Filter and sort data in a Windows Forms application
You filter data by setting the \<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Filter*> property to a string expression that returns the desired records.  
  
 You sort data by setting the \<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Sort*> property to the column name you want to sort on; append `DESC` to sort in descending order, or append `ASC` to sort in ascending order.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If your application does not use \<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> components, you can filter and sort data by using \<xref:System.Data.DataView> objects. For more information, see [DataViews](../Topic/DataViews.md).  
  
## To filter data by using a BindingSource component  
  
-   Set the \<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Filter*> property to the expression you want to return. For example, the following code returns customers with a `CompanyName` that starts with "B":  
  
     [!code[VbRaddataDisplaying#6](../VS_raddata/codesnippet/CSharp/filter-and-sort-data-in-a-windows-forms-application_1.cs)]
[!code[VbRaddataDisplaying#6](../VS_raddata/codesnippet/VisualBasic/filter-and-sort-data-in-a-windows-forms-application_1.vb)]  
  
## To sort data by using a BindingSource component  
  
-   Set the \<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Sort*> property to the column you want to sort on. For example, the following code sorts customers on the `CompanyName` column in descending order:  
  
     [!code[VbRaddataDisplaying#7](../VS_raddata/codesnippet/CSharp/filter-and-sort-data-in-a-windows-forms-application_2.cs)]
[!code[VbRaddataDisplaying#7](../VS_raddata/codesnippet/VisualBasic/filter-and-sort-data-in-a-windows-forms-application_2.vb)]
