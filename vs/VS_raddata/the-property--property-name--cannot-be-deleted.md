# The property &lt;property name&gt; cannot be deleted
The property \<property name> cannot be deleted because it is set as the Discriminator Property for the inheritance between \<class name> and \<class name>  
  
 The selected property is set as the **Discriminator Property** for the inheritance between the classes indicated in the error message. Properties cannot be deleted if they are participating in the inheritance configuration between data classes.  
  
 Set the **Discriminator Property** to a different property of the data class to enable successful deletion of the desired property.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  In the O/R Designer, select the inheritance line that connects the data classes indicated in the error message.  
  
2.  Set the **Discriminator** Property to a different property.  
  
3.  Try to delete the property again.
