# How to: Troubleshoot Unsuccessful Visual Studio Project Upgrades
Sometimes Visual Studio cannot fully convert a project from an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. If the tips in the following sections do not resolve your specific problem, you might be able to find more information on the TechNet [Wiki: Development Portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=254808).  
  
## The Project Does Not Run Because Files Are Not Found  
 A project file contains hard-coded file paths that [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] uses to run the project when you press F5. These paths may include the location of devenv.exe and other required files. In an upgraded version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], the paths of these files may have been changed.  
  
#### To resolve incorrect file paths  
  
1.  Open your project file in a text editor.  
  
2.  Scan for file paths that may be incorrect, especially those that contain a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] version number.  
  
3.  Modify incorrect file paths so that they point to the new targets.  
  
## The Project Does Not Build Because References Are Not Valid  
 When you upgrade [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], you might also be upgrading the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] version. If your project contains references that are discontinued in the newer [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] version, they may not resolve correctly. This is especially likely for references that include version numbers, for example, `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.8.0`.  
  
 If your code has many invalid references, the easiest solution may be to use the multi-targeting feature of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] to target an earlier version of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)].  
  
#### To resolve incorrect references  
  
1.  Open your project file in a text editor.  
  
2.  Open the project properties.  
  
3.  Select the correct **Target Framework** value. Alternatively, you can modify the value of the `<TargetFrameworkVersion>` element directly in the project file.  
  
 If you want your project to run in the upgraded [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] version, you must update the references for the project, and also update any `Imports` or `Using` statements that call the references. If your project loads in the IDE, you can update the references by using **Solution Explorer** or the **Reference Manager** dialog box.
