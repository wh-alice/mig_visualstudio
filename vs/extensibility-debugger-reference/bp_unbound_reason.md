# BP_UNBOUND_REASON
Gives the reason a breakpoint was unbound.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
enum enum_BP_UNBOUND_REASON {   
   BPUR_UNKNOWN           = 0x0000,  
   BPUR_CODE_UNLOADED     = 0x0002,  
   BPUR_BREAKPOINT_REBIND = 0x0003,  
   BPUR_BREAKPOINT_ERROR  = 0x0004  
};  
typedef DWORD BP_UNBOUND_REASON;  
```  
  
```c#  
public enum enum_BP_UNBOUND_REASON {   
   BPUR_UNKNOWN           = 0x0000,  
   BPUR_CODE_UNLOADED     = 0x0002,  
   BPUR_BREAKPOINT_REBIND = 0x0003,  
   BPUR_BREAKPOINT_ERROR  = 0x0004  
};  
```  
  
## Members  
 BPUR_UNKNOWN  
 The reason is unknown.  
  
 BPUR_CODE_UNLOADED  
 The code that contains the breakpoint has been unloaded.  
  
 BPUR_BREAKPOINT_REBIND  
 The breakpoint has been rebound to a different location. This can happen after Edit and Continue operations when the breakpoint moves, or when the breakpoint is bound to a file with a path that is no longer valid.  
  
 BPUR_ BREAKPOINT_ERROR  
 The breakpoint is determined to be in error after it is bound. This happens to managed breakpoints whose conditions are no longer valid.
