# Special Characters to Escape
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../code-quality/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Special characters must be escaped only if they have special meaning in the context in which they are being used. For example, the asterisk (*) is a special character only in the "Include" and "Exclude" attributes of an item definition, or in a call to <xref:Microsoft.Build.Tasks.CreateItem>. In all other cases, the asterisk is treated as a literal asterisk. While you do not need to escape asterisks everywhere in project files, doing so does no harm.  
  
 Use the notation %*xx* in place of the special character, where *xx* represents the hexadecimal value of the ASCII character. For example, to use an asterisk (*) as a literal character, use the value `%2A`.  
  
 The full list of special characters to escape follows:  
  
|Character|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|%|Percent sign, used to reference metadata.|  
|$|Dollar sign, used to reference properties.|  
|@|At sign, used to reference item lists.|  
|(|Open parenthesis, used in lists.|  
|)|Close parenthesis, used in lists.|  
|`|Apostrophe (or tick mark), used in conditions and other expressions.|  
|;|Semicolon, a list separator.|  
|?|Question mark, a wildcard character when describing a file spec in an item's Include/Exclude section.|  
|*|Asterisk, a wildcard character when describing a file spec in an item's Include/Exclude section.|
