## Cause  
 A method that is marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> or the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute is externally visible.  
  
## Rule Description  
 When an assembly is registered with Component Object Model (COM), entries are added to the registry for each COM-visible type in the assembly. Methods that are marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute> and <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute> attributes are called during the registration and unregistration processes, respectively, to run user code that is specific to the registration/unregistration of these types. This code should not be called outside these processes.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, change the accessibility of the method to `private` or `internal` (`Friend` in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../codequality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]).  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows two methods that violate the rule.  
  
 [!code[FxCop.Interoperability.ComRegistration2#1](../codequality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1411--com-registration-methods-should-not-be-visible_1.cs)]
[!code[FxCop.Interoperability.ComRegistration2#1](../codequality/codesnippet/VisualBasic/ca1411--com-registration-methods-should-not-be-visible_1.vb)]
