# C6282
warning C6282: Incorrect operator: assignment of constant in Boolean context. Consider using '==' instead  
  
 This warning indicates that an assignment of a constant to a variable was detected in a test context. Assignment of a constant to a variable in a test context is almost always incorrect. Replace the `=` with `==`, or remove the assignment from the test context to resolve this warning.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
void f( int i )  
{  
   while (i = 5)  
   {  
   // code    
   }  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
```  
void f( int i )  
{  
   while (i == 5)  
   {  
   // code    
   }  
}  
```
