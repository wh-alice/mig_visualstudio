## Cause  
 A public or protected type contains only static members and is not declared with the [sealed](../Topic/sealed%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md) ([NotInheritable](../Topic/NotInheritable%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md)) modifier.  
  
## Rule Description  
 This rule assumes that a type that contains only static members is not designed to be inherited, because the type does not provide any functionality that can be overridden in a derived type. A type that is not meant to be inherited should be marked with the `sealed` modifier to prohibit its use as a base type.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, mark the type as `sealed`. If you are targeting [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../codequality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] 2.0 or earlier, a better approach is to mark the type as `static`. In this manner, you avoid having to declare a private constructor to prevent the class from being created.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Suppress a warning from this rule only if the type is designed to be inherited. The absence of the `sealed` modifier suggests that the type is useful as a base type.  
  
## Example of a Violation  
  
### Description  
 The following example shows a type that violates the rule.  
  
### Code  
 [!code[FxCop.Design.StaticMembers#1](../codequality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1052--static-holder-types-should-be-sealed_1.cs)]
[!code[FxCop.Design.StaticMembers#1](../codequality/codesnippet/VisualBasic/ca1052--static-holder-types-should-be-sealed_1.vb)]
[!code[FxCop.Design.StaticMembers#1](../codequality/codesnippet/CPP/ca1052--static-holder-types-should-be-sealed_1.cpp)]  
  
## Fix with the Static Modifier  
  
### Description  
 The following example shows how to fix a violation of this rule by marking the type with the `static` modifier.
