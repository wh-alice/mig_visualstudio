# The Visual Studio Image Library
The Visual Studio Image Library contains application images that appear in Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft Windows, the Office system and other Microsoft software. This set of over 1,000 images can be used to create applications that look visually consistent with Microsoft software.  
  
 [Download the Visual Studio Image Library](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=275090)  
  
 The image library is divided into five categories: Common Elements, Actions, Annotations, Icons and Objects. Readme files are included in the PDF format for the Common Elements and Icon types. They contain information about how to use these images appropriately in your applications.
