>  The information in this section may apply only to users who license Microsoft products in the United States. If you obtained this product outside of the United States, you can use the subsidiary information card that came with your software package or visit the [Microsoft Accessibility site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=75069) for a list of Microsoft support services telephone numbers and addresses.

Information about accessibility is available in other languages, including Japanese and French.  
  
## Accessibility features of Windows  
 The Windows operating system has many built-in accessibility features that are useful for individuals who have difficulty typing or using a mouse, are blind or have low vision, or who are deaf or have hearing impairments. The features are installed during Setup. For more information about these features, see Help in Windows and the [Microsoft Accessibility site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=75069).  
  
### Free step-by-step tutorials  
 Microsoft offers a series of step-by-step tutorials that provide detailed procedures for adjusting the accessibility options and settings on your computer. This information is presented in a side-by-side format so that you can learn how to use the mouse, the keyboard, or a combination of both.  
  
 To find step-by-step tutorials for Microsoft products, see the [Microsoft Accessibility site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=75069).  
  
### Assistive technology products for Windows  
 A wide variety of assistive technology products are available to make computers easier to use for people with disabilities. You can search a catalog of assistive technology products that run on Windows at the [Microsoft Accessibility site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=75069).  
  
 If you use assistive technology, be sure to contact your assistive technology vendor before you upgrade your software or hardware to check for possible compatibility issues.  
  
## Documentation in alternative formats  
 If you have difficulty reading or handling printed materials, you can obtain the documentation for many Microsoft products in more accessible formats. You can view an index of accessible product documentation on the [Microsoft Accessibility site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=75069).  
  
 In addition, you can obtain additional Microsoft publications from Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic, Inc (RFB&D).
