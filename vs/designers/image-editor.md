# Image Editor
This document describes how to work with the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Image Editor to view and modify texture and image resources.  
  
 You can use the Image Editor to work with the kinds of rich texture and image formats that are used in DirectX app development—this includes support for popular image file formats and color encodings, features such as alpha-channels and MIP-mapping, and many of the highly-compressed, hardware-accelerated texture formats that DirectX supports.  
  
## Supported formats  
 The Image Editor supports these image formats:  
  
|Format name|File Name Extension|  
|-----------------|-------------------------|  
|Portable Network Graphics|.png|  
|JPEG|.jpg, .jpeg, .jpe, .jfif|  
|Direct Draw Surface|.dds|  
|Graphics Interchange Format|.gif|  
|Bitmap|.bmp, .dib|  
|Tagged Image File Format|.tif, .tiff|  
|TGA (Targa)|.tga|  
  
## Getting started  
 This section describes how to add an image to your [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project and configure it for your requirements.  
  
#### To add an image to your project  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for the project that you want to add the image to, and then choose **Add**, **New Item**.  
  
2.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, under **Installed**, select **Graphics**, and then select an appropriate file format for the image. For information about how to choose a file format based on your requirements, see the following section.  
  
3.  Specify the **Name** of the image file, and the **Location** where you want it to be created.  
  
4.  Choose the **Add** button.  
  
### Choosing the image format  
 Depending on how you plan to use the image, certain file formats might be more appropriate than others. For example, some formats might not support a feature that you need—like transparency or a specific color format—or might not provide suitable compression for the kind of image content you have planned.  
  
 The following information can help you choose an image format that meets your needs.  
  
 **Bitmap Image (.bmp)**  
 The bitmap image format. An uncompressed image format that supports 24-bit color. The bitmap format doesn't support transparency.  
  
 **GIF Image (.gif)**  
 The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) image format. An LZW-compressed, lossless image format that supports up to 256 colors. Unsuitable for photographs and images that have a significant amount of color detail, but provides good compression ratios for low-color images that have a high degree of color coherence.  
  
 **JPG Image (.jpg)**  
 The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) image format. A highly-compressed, lossy image format that supports 24-bit color and is suitable for general-purpose compression of images that have a high degree of color coherence.  
  
 **PNG Image (.png)**  
 The Portable Network Graphics (PNG) image format. A moderately-compressed, lossless image format that supports 24-bit color and alpha transparency. It is suitable for both natural and artificial images, but does not provide compression ratios as good as lossy formats such as JPG or GIF.  
  
 **TIFF Image (.tif)**  
 The Tagged Image File Format (TIFF or TIF) image format. A flexible image format that supports several compression schemes.  
  
 **DDS Texture (.dds)**  
 The DirectDraw Surface (DDS) texture format. A highly-compressed, lossy texture format that supports 24-bit color and alpha transparency. Its compression ratios can be as high as 8:1. It's based on S3 Texture compression, which can be decompressed on graphics hardware.  
  
 **TGA Image (.tga)**  
 The Truevision Graphics Adapter (TGA) image format (also known as Targa). An RLE-compressed, lossless image format that supports both color-mapped (color palette) or direct-color images of up to 24-bit color and alpha transparency. Unsuitable for photographs and images that have a significant amount of color detail, but provides good compression ratios for images that have long spans of identical colors.  
  
### Configuring the image  
 Before you begin to work with the image that you just created, you can change its default configuration. For example, you can change its dimensions or the color format that it uses. For information about how to configure these and other properties of the image, see [Image properties](#ImageProperties).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Before you save your work, make sure to set the **Color Format** property if you want to use a specific color format. If the file format supports compression, you can adjust the compression settings when you save the file for the first time or when you choose **Save As**.  
  
## Working with the Image Editor  
 This section describes how to use the Image Editor to modify textures and images.  
  
### Image Editor toolbars  
 The Image Editor toolbars contain commands that help you work with images.  
  
 Commands that affect the state of the Image Editor are located on the **Image Editor Mode** toolbar together with advanced commands. The toolbar is located along the topmost edge of the Image Editor design surface. Drawing tools are located on the **Image Editor** toolbar along the leftmost edge of the Image Editor design surface.  
  
 Here's the **Image Editor Mode** toolbar:  
  
 ![The Image Editor modal toolbar.](../designers/media/digit-tre-modal-toolbar.png "Digit-TRE-Modal-Toolbar")  
  
 This table describes the items on the **Image Editor Mode** toolbar, which are listed in the order in which they appear from left to right.  
  
|Toolbar Item|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|**Select**|Enables selection of a rectangular region of an image. After you select a region, you can cut, copy, move, scale, rotate, flip, or delete it. When there is an active selection, drawing tools only affect the selected region.|  
|**Irregular Selection**|Enables selection of an irregular region of an image. After you select a region, you can cut, copy, move, scale, rotate, flip, or delete it. When there is an active selection, drawing tools only affect the selected region.|  
|**Wand Selection**|Enables selection of a similarly-colored region of an image. The *tolerance*—that is, the maximum difference between adjacent colors within which they are considered similar—can be configured to include a smaller or wider range of similar colors. After you select a region, you can cut, copy, move, scale, rotate, flip, or delete it. When there is an active selection, drawing tools only affect the selected region.|  
|**Pan**|Enables movement of the image relative to the window frame. In **Pan** mode, select a point on the image and then move it around.<br /><br /> You can temporarily activate **Pan** mode by pressing and holding the Ctrl key.|  
|**Zoom**|Enables the display of more or less image detail relative to the window frame. In **Zoom** mode, select a point on the image and then move it right or down to zoom in, or left or up to zoom out.<br /><br /> You can zoom in or out by pressing and holding Ctrl while you either use the mouse wheel or press the Plus Sign (+) or Minus Sign (-).|  
|**Zoom to Actual Size**|Displays the image by using a 1:1 relationship between the pixels of the image and the pixels of the screen.|  
|**Zoom To Fit**|Displays the full image in the window frame.|  
|**Zoom To Width**|Displays the full width of the image in the window frame.|  
|**Grid**|Enables or disables the grid that shows pixel boundaries. The grid might not appear until you zoom into the image.|  
|**View Next MIP Level**|Activates the next larger MIP level in a MIP map chain. The active MIP level is displayed on the design surface. This item is only available for textures that have MIP levels.|  
|**View Previous MIP Level**|Activates the next smaller MIP level in a MIP map chain. The active MIP level is displayed on the design surface. This item is only available for textures that have MIP levels.|  
|**Red Channel**<br /><br /> **Green Channel**<br /><br /> **Blue Channel**<br /><br /> **Alpha Channel**|Enables or disables the specific color channel. **Note:**  By systematically enabling or disabling color channels, you can isolate problems that are related to one or more of them. For example, you could identify incorrect alpha transparency.|  
|**Background**|Enables or disables display of the background through transparent parts of the image. You can configure how the background is displayed by choosing from these options:<br /><br /> **Checkerboard**<br /> Uses a green color together with the specified background color to display the background as a checkerboard pattern. You can use this option to help make transparent parts of the image more apparent.<br /><br /> White Background<br /> Uses the color white to display the background.<br /><br /> Black Background<br /> Uses the color black to display the background.<br /><br /> Animate Background<br /> Pans the checkerboard pattern slowly. You can use this option to help make transparent parts of the image more apparent.|  
|**Properties**|Alternately opens or closes the **Properties** window.|  
|**Advanced**|Contains additional commands and options.<br /><br /> **Filters**<br /><br /> Provides several common image filters: **Black and White**, **Blur**, **Brighten**, **Darken**, **Edge Detection**, **Emboss**, **Invert Colors**, **Ripple**, **Sepia Tone**, and **Sharpen**.<br /><br /> **Graphics Engines**<br /><br /> **Render with D3D11**<br /> Uses Direct3D 11 to render the Image Editor design surface.<br /><br /> **Render with D3D11WARP**<br /> Uses Direct3D 11 Windows Advanced Rasterization Platform (WARP) to render the Image Editor design surface.<br /><br /> **Tools**<br /><br /> **Flip Horizontal**<br /> Transposes the image around its horizontal, or x, axis.<br /><br /> **Flip Vertical**<br /> Transposes the image around its vertical, or y, axis.<br /><br /> **Generate Mips**<br /> Generates MIP levels for an image. If MIP levels already exist, they are recreated from the largest MIP level. Any changes that were made to smaller MIP levels are lost. To save the MIP levels that you have generated, you must use the .dds format to save the image.<br /><br /> **View**<br /><br /> **Frame Rate**<br /> When enabled, displays the frame rate in the upper-right corner of the design surface. The frame rate is the number of frames that are drawn per second. **Tip:**  You can choose the **Advanced** button to run the last command again.|  
  
 Here's the **Image Editor** toolbar.  
  
 ![Image Editor toolbar](../designers/media/digit-tre-toolbar.png "Digit-TRE-Toolbar")  
  
 The following table describes the items on the **Image Editor** toolbar, which are listed in the order in which they appear from top to bottom.  
  
|Toolbar Item|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|**Pencil**|Uses the active color selection to draw an aliased stroke. You can set the color and thickness of the stroke in the **Properties** window.|  
|**Brush**|Uses the active color selection to draw an anti-aliased stroke. You can set the color and thickness of the stroke in the **Properties** window.|  
|**Airbrush**|Uses the active color selection to draw an anti-aliased stroke that blends together with the image and becomes more saturated as a function of time. You can set the color and thickness of the stroke in the **Properties** window.|  
|**Eyedropper**|Sets the active color selection to the color of the selected pixel.|  
|**Fill**|Uses the active color selection to fill a region of the image. The affected region is defined as the pixel where the fill is applied, together with every pixel that is connected to it by pixels of the same color and that is the same color itself. If the fill is applied within an active selection, then the affected region is constrained by the selection.<br /><br /> By default, the active color selection is blended together with the affected region of the image according to its alpha component. To use the active color selection to overwrite the affected region, press and hold the Shift key when you use the fill tool.|  
|**Eraser**|Sets pixels to the fully transparent color if the image supports an alpha channel. Otherwise, sets the pixels to the active background color.|  
|**Line**, **Rectangle**, **Rounded Rectangle**, **Ellipse**|Draws a shape on the image. You can set the color and thickness of the outline in the **Properties** window.<br /><br /> To draw a primitive that has equal width and height, press and hold Shift as you draw.|  
|**Text**|Uses the foreground color selection to draw text. The background color is determined by the background color selection. For a transparent background, the alpha value of the background color selection must be 0. While the text region is active, you can set whether the text is drawn with an anti-aliased stroke, and you can set the text **Value**, **Font**, **Size**, and style—**Bold**, **Italics**, or **Underlined**—in the **Properties** window. The content and appearance of the text is finalized when the text region is no longer active.|  
|**Rotate**|Rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise.|  
|**Trim**|Trims the image to the active selection.|  
  
### Working with MIP levels  
 Some image formats—for example, DirectDraw Surface (.dds)—support MIP levels for texture-space Level-of-Detail (LOD). For information about how to generate and work with MIP levels, see [How to: Create and Modify MIP Levels](../designers/how-to--create-and-modify-mip-levels.md)  
  
### Working with transparency  
 Some image formats—for example, DirectDraw Surface (.dds)—support transparency. There are several ways that transparency can be used, depending on the tool that you are using. To specify the level of transparency for a color selection, in the **Properties** window, set the **A** (alpha) component of the color selection. Here's how different kinds of tools control how transparency is applied:  
  
|Tool|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|**Pencil**, **Brush**, **Airbrush**, **Line**, **Rectangle**, **Rounded Rectangle**, **Ellipse**, **Text**|To blend the active color selection together with the image, in the **Properties** window, expand the **Channels** property group and set the **Draw** checkbox on the **Alpha** channel, and then draw normally.<br /><br /> To draw by using the active color selection and leave the alpha value of the image in place, clear the **Draw** checkbox of the **Alpha** channel, and then draw normally.|  
|**Fill**|To blend the active color selection together with the image, just choose the area to fill.<br /><br /> To use the active color selection—including the value of the alpha channel—to overwrite the image, press and hold Shift and then choose the area to fill.|  
  
###  <a name="ImageProperties"></a> Image properties  
 You can use the **Properties** window to specify various properties of the image. For example, you can set the Width and Height properties to resize the image.  
  
 The following table describes image properties.  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|Width|The width of the image.|  
|Height|The height of the image.|  
|Bits Per Pixel|The number of bits that represent each pixel. The value of this property depends on the **Color Format** of the image.|  
|Transparent Selection|**True** to blend the selection layer together with the main image, based on the alpha value of the selection layer; otherwise, **False**. This item is only available for images that support alpha.|  
|Format|The color format of the image. A variety of color formats can be specified, depending on the image format. The color format defines the number and kind of color channels that are included in the image, and also the size and encoding of various channels.|  
|Mip Level|The active MIP level. This item is only available for textures that have MIP levels.|  
|Mip Level Count|The total number of MIP levels in the image. This item is only available for textures that have MIP levels.|  
|Frame Count|The total number of frames in the image. This item is only available for images that support texture arrays.|  
|Frame|The current frame. Only the first frame can be viewed; all other frames are lost when the image is saved.|  
|Depth Slice Count|The total number of depth slices in the image. This item is only available for images that support volume textures.|  
|Depth Slice|The current depth slice. Only the first slice can be viewed; all other slices are lost when the image is saved.|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Because the **Rotate by** property applies to all tools and selected regions, it always appears at the bottom of the **Properties** window together with other tool properties. **Rotate by** is always displayed because the whole image is implicitly selected when there is no other selection or active tool. For more information about the **Rotate by** property, see [Tool Properties](#ToolProperties).  
  
#### Resizing images  
 Here are two ways to resize an image. In both cases, the Image Editor uses bi-linear interpolation to resample the image.  
  
-   In the **Properties** window, specify new values for the **Width** and **Height** properties.  
  
-   Select the entire image and use the border markers to resize the image.  
  
### Working with tools  
  
#### Selected regions  
 Selections in the Image Editor define regions of the image that are active—that is, the region will be affected by tools and transformations. When there is an active selection, areas outside the selected region are not affected by most tools and transformations. If there is not an active selection, the entire image is active.  
  
 Most tools—**Pencil**, **Brush**, **Airbrush**, **Fill**, **Eraser**, and 2-D primitives—and transformations—**Rotate**, **Trim**, **Invert Colors**, **Flip Horizontal**, and **Flip Vertical**—are constrained or defined by the active selection. However, some tools—**Eyedropper** and **Text**—and transformations—**Generate Mips**—are not affected by any active selection; these tools always behave as if the entire image is the active selection.  
  
 While you are selecting a region, you can press and hold Shift to make a proportional (square) selection; otherwise, the selection is not constrained.  
  
##### Resizing selections  
 After you select a region, you can resize it or its image contents by changing the size of the selection marker. While you are resizing the selected region, you can use the following modifier keys to change the behavior of the selected region as you resize it (press and hold the key as you resize).  
  
 Ctrl  
 Copies the contents of the selected region before it's resized. This leaves the original image intact while the copy is resized.  
  
 Shift  
 Resizes the selected region in proportion to its original size.  
  
 Alt  
 Changes the size of the selection region. This leaves the image unmodified.  
  
 Here are the valid modifier key combinations:  
  
|Ctrl|Shift|Alt|Description|  
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------------|  
||||Resizes the content of the selected region.|  
||Shift||Proportionally resizes the content of the selected region.|  
|||Alt|Resizes the selected region. This defines a new selection region.|  
||Shift|Alt|Proportionally resizes the selected region. This defines a new selection region.|  
|Ctrl|||Copies and then resizes the content of the selected region.|  
|Ctrl|Shift||Copies and then proportionally resizes the content of the selected region.|  
  
####  <a name="ToolProperties"></a> Tool Properties  
 While a tool is selected, you can use the **Properties** window to specify details about how it affects the image. For example, you can set the thickness of the **Pencil** tool or the color of the **Brush** tool.  
  
 You can set both a foreground color and a background color. Both support an alpha channel to provide user-defined opacity. The settings apply to all tools. If you use a mouse, the left mouse button corresponds to the foreground color, and the right mouse button corresponds to the background color.  
  
 The following table describes tool properties.  
  
|Tool|Properties|  
|----------|----------------|  
|All tools and selections|**Rotate by**<br /> Defines the amount, in degrees, that the selection or tool effect is rotated in the clockwise direction.|  
|**Pencil**, **Brush**, **Airbrush**, **Eraser**|**Thickness**<br /> Defines the size of the area that is affected by the tool.|  
|**Text**|**Anti-alias**<br /> Draws text that has anti-aliased edges. This gives text a smoother appearance.<br /><br /> **Value**<br /> The text to be drawn.<br /><br /> **Font**<br /> The font used to draw the text.<br /><br /> **Size**<br /> The size of the text.<br /><br /> **Bold**<br /> Makes the font bold.<br /><br /> **Italics**<br /> Makes the font italic.<br /><br /> **Underlined**<br /> Makes the font underlined.|  
|**2-D Primitive**|**Anti-alias**<br /> Draws primitives that have anti-aliased edges. This gives them a smoother appearance.<br /><br /> **Thickness**<br /> Defines the thickness of the line that forms the boundary of the primitive.<br /><br /> **Radius X**<br /> (Rounded rectangle only) Defines the rounding radius for the top and bottom edges of the primitive.<br /><br /> **Radius Y**<br /> (Rounded rectangle only) Defines the rounding radius for the left and right edges of the primitive.|  
|**Pencil**, **Brush**, **Airbrush**, **2-D Primitive**|**Channels**<br /> Enables or disables specific color channels for viewing and drawing. If **View** is set for a specific color channel, that channel is visible in the image; otherwise, it is not visible. If **Draw** is set for a specific color channel, that channel is affected by drawing operations; otherwise, it is not.|  
|**Wand Selection**, **Fill**|**Tolerance**<br /> Defines the maximum difference between adjacent colors within which they are considered similar, so that fewer or more similar colors are made a part of the affected or selected region. By default, the value is 32, which means that adjacent pixels within 32 shades (lighter or darker) of the original color are considered to be part of the region.|
