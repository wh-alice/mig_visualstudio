# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.Net.HttpListenerException
An \<xref:System.Net.HttpListenerException> is thrown when an error occurs processing a Hypertext Transfer Protocol request.  
  
## Associated Tips  
 Make sure you are not attempting to register a URI prefix that is already registered.  
 If the URI prefix is already registered, this exception will occur.  
  
 Make sure your HTTP request is valid.  
 This exception is thrown by the \<xref:System.Net.HttpListener> class and its associated classes when an error occurs during the initialization of the \<xref:System.Net.HttpListener> or while creating or sending a response to an HTTP request.  
  
 If you are using the `HttpListenerPrefixCollection.Add` method, make sure the `uriPrefix` has not been already added.  
 This exception will be thrown if another \<xref:System.Net.HttpListener> has already added the prefix `uriPrefix`.
