# Visual Studio SDK and Managed Code
*Managed code* is code that is written in any language that targets the common language runtime (CLR), such as [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_debugger/includes/vbprvb_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../VS_debugger/includes/csprcs_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../VS_debugger/includes/vcprvc_md.md)]. Regardless of the language that it is written in, all managed code is compiled into Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) instead of native code.  
  
## Environment Support for Managed VSPackages  
 To support creating a VSPackage or project with a managed language such as [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../VS_debugger/includes/csprcs_md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../VS_IDE/includes/vsipsdk_md.md)] provides the following:  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] interop assemblies, which enable VSPackages written in managed code to interoperate with the unmanaged (COM) [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE). For more information, see [Using Visual Studio Interop Assemblies](../Topic/Using%20Visual%20Studio%20Interop%20Assemblies.md).  
  
-   A set of Managed Package Framework (MPF) classes that provides a higher-level abstraction for working with the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] IDE. These classes encapsulate some of the most frequently used interfaces and types in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] interop assemblies. They greatly reduce the amount of work that you must do to provide the basic functionality of a VSPackage or project. For more information, see [Managed Package Framework Classes](../VS_not_in_toc/managed-package-framework-classes.md).  
  
-   A set of basic VSPackage samples written in managed code. The managed samples build on an example of a simple, fully functional VSPackage to demonstrate a basic editor, a tool window, an object extender, and other components. For more information, see [VSSDK Samples](../VS_not_in_toc/vssdk-samples.md).
