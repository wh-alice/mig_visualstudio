# How to: Use GetGlobalService
Sometimes you may need to get a service from a tool window or control container that has not been sited, or else has been sited with a service provider that does not know about the service you want. For example, you might want to write to the activity log from within a control. For more information about these and other scenarios, see [How to: Troubleshoot Services](../Topic/How%20to:%20Troubleshoot%20Services.md).  
  
 You can get most [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] services by calling the static \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package.GetGlobalService*> method.  
  
 \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package.GetGlobalService*> relies on a cached service provider that is initialized the first time any VSPackage derived from \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package> is sited. You must guarantee that this condition is met, or else be prepared for a null service.  
  
 Fortunately, \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package.GetGlobalService*> works correctly most of the time.  
  
-   If a VSPackage provides a service known only to another VSPackage, the VSPackage requesting the service is sited before the VSPackage providing the service is loaded.  
  
-   If a tool window is created by a VSPackage, the VSPackage is sited before the tool window is created.  
  
-   If a control container is hosted by a tool window created by a VSPackage, the VSPackage is sited before the control container is created.  
  
### To get a service from within a tool window or control container  
  
-   Insert this code in the constructor, tool window, or control container:  
  
     [!code[UseGetGlobalService#1](../VS_not_in_toc/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to--use-getglobalservice_1.vb)]
[!code[UseGetGlobalService#1](../VS_not_in_toc/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to--use-getglobalservice_1.cs)]  
  
     This code obtains an SVsActivityLog service and casts it to an \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsActivityLog> interface, which can be used to write to the activity log. For an example, see [How to: Use the Activity Log](../Topic/How%20to:%20Use%20the%20Activity%20Log.md).
