# &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; cannot be used as an attribute because it has &#39;MustOverride&#39; methods that have not been overridden
Classes with `MustOverride` methods cannot be used as attributes.  
  
 `MustOverride` members of attribute classes can only be used from derived classes that override such members.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31507  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Remove the `MustOverride` modifier from attribute class members.  
  
2.  Implement `MustOverride` members in a derived class, and use that class as an attribute.
