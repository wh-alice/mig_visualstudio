# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.BadImageFormatException
A \<xref:System.BadImageFormatException> exception is thrown when the file image of a DLL or executable program is not valid.  
  
## Associated Tips  
 **If your application uses 32-bit components, make sure that it always runs as a 32-bit application.**  
 If the **Platform target** property for your application project is set to `AnyCPU`, the compiled application can be run in either 64-bit or 32-bit mode. When it runs as a 64-bit application, the just-in-time (JIT) compiler produces 64-bit native code. If the application depends on a 32-bit managed or unmanaged component, that component will fail to load in 64-bit mode. To correct this problem, set the project's **Platform target** property to `x86` and recompile.  
  
 **Make sure that you are not using a component that was created with a different version of the .NET Framework.**  
 This exception is thrown when an application or component that was developed by using the [!INCLUDE[net_v10_short](../Token/net_v10_short_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[net_v11_short](../Token/net_v11_short_md.md)] attempts to load an assembly that was developed by using the [!INCLUDE[net_v20SP1_short](../Token/net_v20SP1_short_md.md)] or later, or when an application that was developed by using the [!INCLUDE[net_v20SP1_short](../Token/net_v20SP1_short_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](../Token/net_v35_short_md.md)] attempts to load an assembly that was developed by using the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../VS_debugger/includes/net_v40_short_md.md)]. The \<xref:System.BadImageFormatException> exception may be reported as a compile-time error, or the exception may be thrown at run time. See the \<xref:System.BadImageFormatException> class for an example.  
  
 **Make sure that the file image is a valid managed assembly or module.**  
 This exception is thrown when an unmanaged dynamic link library or executable is passed to the \<xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.Load*> method for loading.  
  
 For more information, Visual Basic users can refer to [Troubleshooting Interoperability](../Topic/Troubleshooting%20Interoperability%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md).  
  
## Remarks  
 Reflecting on C++ executable files may throw this exception. This is most likely caused by the C++ compiler stripping the relocation addresses or the .Reloc section from the executable file. To preserve the .relocation address in a C++ executable file, specify **/fixed:no** when linking.  
  
 For more causes of this exception, see the \<xref:System.BadImageFormatException> class.
