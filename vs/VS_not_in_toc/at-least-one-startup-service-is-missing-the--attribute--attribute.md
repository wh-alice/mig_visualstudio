# At least one startup service is missing the &#39;attribute&#39; attribute
A startup service requires the ID attribute, which was not found on a `<Service>` element. For example:  
  
```  
<Service ID="{0000-0000-0000-00000000-000000000000}"/>  
```  
  
 This indicates that the project file is corrupt.  
  
 This error is most likely caused by editing the project file by hand.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Save the project file.  
  
     The defective section will not be written out and this error will not occur the next time you open the project.
