# Source name specified in EventLogSource is registered to a log other than that specified in EventLogName
The `EventLog` is attempting to refer to a source that is registered to a different log. If you are writing entries to an event log, you must specify the \<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source*> property. The \<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source*> property registers your component with the event log as a valid source of entries. A single source can be associated with (and therefore write entries to) only one event log at a time.  
  
 By default, if you try to write an entry without first having registered your component as a valid source, the system automatically registers the source with the event log, using the value of the \<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source*> property as the source string.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure the source is registered to the correct log. To do this, use the \<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource*> method or one of its overloads to specify a string that uniquely identifies your component to the event log.
