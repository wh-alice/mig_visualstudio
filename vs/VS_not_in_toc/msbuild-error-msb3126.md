# MSBuild Error MSB3126
**MSB3126: The application is using file associations but is not marked for installation. File associations cannot be used for applications that are not installed such as applications hosted in a web browser.**  
  
 This error occurs when an application is configured to use file associations but the application's install mode is set to online only. Because online only applications typically run in a browser, file associations are not available.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Set the **Install Mode and Settings** to **The application is available offline as well (launchable from Start menu)**. For more information, see [How to: Specify the ClickOnce Offline or Online Install Mode](../VS_IDE/how-to--specify-the-clickonce-offline-or-online-install-mode.md).
