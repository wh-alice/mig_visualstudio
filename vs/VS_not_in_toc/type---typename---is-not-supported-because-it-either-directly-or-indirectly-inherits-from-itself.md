# Type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; is not supported because it either directly or indirectly inherits from itself
A class or interface either inherits from itself or from another class or interface which ultimately inherits from it.  
  
 Visual Basic does not support circular inheritance.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30916  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Change the inheritance structure so that it is built on a base class or interface that does not inherit from any other class or interface.
