# Cannot copy multifile assembly component &#39;component_filename&#39; to file &#39;destination_filename&#39;. &lt;reason.&gt;
The specified component was not copied to the bin directory.  
  
 Some assemblies consist of multiple files. This diagnostic is displayed whenever a file that is part of a multifile assembly cannot be copied to the run directory.  
  
 There could be several reasons for failure. For example, running out of disk space or reaching the MAX_PATH limit for path lengths. Also, a process, perhaps Visual Studio, might be holding onto the component that cannot be copied.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Check for adequate free disk space.  
  
-   Try moving the project to a folder whose path length is less than the path length of the current project folder.  
  
-   Change the output directory to a folder with a smaller absolute path length. This is applicable for client (non-Web) projects only.  
  
-   Restart [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].
