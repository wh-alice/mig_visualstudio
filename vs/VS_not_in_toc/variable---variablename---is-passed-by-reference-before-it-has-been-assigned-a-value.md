# Variable &#39;&lt;variablename&gt;&#39; is passed by reference before it has been assigned a value
Variable '\<variablename>' is passed by reference before it has been assigned a value. A null reference exception could result at run time.  
  
 A procedure call passes a variable as an argument to a `ByRef` parameter before any value is assigned to the variable.  
  
 If a variable has never been assigned a value, it holds the default value for its data type. For a reference data type, that default value is [Nothing](../Topic/Nothing%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md). Reading a reference variable that has a value of `Nothing` can cause a \<xref:System.NullReferenceException> in some circumstances.  
  
 Passing an argument to a procedure `ByRef` exposes the variable underlying the argument to possible modification by the procedure.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For more information about hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](../VS_IDE/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42030  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   If you intend the procedure to assign a value to the variable through the `ByRef` argument, and if it does not matter whether the variable already holds a value, then no action is necessary.  
  
-   If the logic in the procedure reads the argument before assigning any value to it, and if the variable is of a value type, then make sure that the procedure logic does not depend on whether the variable holds its default value or not.  
  
-   If the logic in the procedure reads the argument before assigning any value to it, and if the variable is of a reference type, then make sure that the procedure logic can handle a value of `Nothing`. For example, it could use a [Try...Catch...Finally Statement](../Topic/Try...Catch...Finally%20Statement%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md) to catch a \<xref:System.NullReferenceException>.
