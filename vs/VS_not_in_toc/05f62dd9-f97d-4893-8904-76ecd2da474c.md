# Type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; and partial type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; declared in &#39;&lt;filename&gt;&#39; conflict in container &#39;&lt;containername&gt;&#39;, but are being merged because one of them is declared partial
A class or structure is appears in multiple definitions in the same container type, and more than one definition is not marked `Partial`.  
  
 You must use the [Partial](../Topic/Partial%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md) keyword on at least one of the multiple definitions of a class or structure, but it is recommended that you use it on all the partial definitions.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](../VS_IDE/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40047
