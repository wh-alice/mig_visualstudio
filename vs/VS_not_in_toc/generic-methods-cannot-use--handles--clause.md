# Generic methods cannot use &#39;Handles&#39; clause
A generic `Sub` procedure includes a [Handles](../Topic/Handles%20Clause%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md) clause in its declaration.  
  
 A `Handles` clause specifies a list of events that the `Sub` procedure handles. To be an event handler, the `Sub` procedure must have the same signature as each event it is to handle. A generic procedure can be created more than once, with signatures that [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_debugger/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] cannot predict at compile time. Therefore, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_debugger/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] cannot guarantee a signature that matches those of the events in the `Handles` clause.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32080  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   If the `Sub` procedure needs to be generic, remove the `Handles` clause from its declaration. Use the [AddHandler Statement](../Topic/AddHandler%20Statement.md) to associate this event handler with an event.  
  
-   If the `Sub` procedure needs to use the `Handles` clause to associate events, remove the [Of](../Topic/Of%20Clause%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md) clause from its declaration. You must use a nongeneric procedure with `Handles`.
