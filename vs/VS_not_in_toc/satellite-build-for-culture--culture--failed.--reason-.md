# Satellite build for culture &#39;culture&#39; failed. &lt;reason&gt;
A satellite assembly for a particular culture could not be built. This error will cause the build process to fail.  
  
 This error can appear for two reasons:  
  
1.  ALINK.EXE is not installed on the system.  
  
2.  ALINK.EXE failed but did not return any extended error information.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Reinstall [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] or just the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../VS_debugger/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)].  
  
-   When \<reason> is reported as "The assembly linker could not be launched. The file exists," empty the Temp folder in which the files are generated (for example, C:\Documents and Settings\\<user\>\Local Settings\Temp).
