# Resource Compiler Error RC2180
unable to open temporary file  
  
 The Resource Compiler/Visual C++ was unable to open a temporary file. The probable cause is either that you do not have write permissions for the directory, or that the directory does not exist. The Resource Compiler/Visual C++ attempts to use these files in the directory specified by the **TMP** environment variable or the current directory if none is specified.
