# C6303
warning C6303: format string mismatch: wide character string passed as parameter \<number> when character string is required in call to \<function>  
  
 This warning indicates that the format string specifies that a character string is required. However, a wide character string is being passed. This defect is likely to cause a crash or corruption of some form.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample code generates this warning:  
  
```  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
void f()  
{  
  wchar_t buff[5] = L"hi";  
  
  printf("%s", buff);  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use `%ls` as shown in the following sample code:  
  
```  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
void f()  
{  
  wchar_t buff[5] = L"hi";  
  
  printf("%ls", buff);  
}  
```  
  
 The following sample code uses safe string manipulation function `printf_s` to correct this warning:  
  
```  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
void f()  
{  
  wchar_t buff[5] = L"hi";  
  
  printf_s("%ls",buff);  
}  
```
