## Cause  
 A type or method is coupled with many other types.  
  
## Rule Description  
 This rule measures class coupling by counting the number of unique type references that a type or method contains.  
  
 Types and methods that have a high degree of class coupling can be difficult to maintain. It is a good practice to have types and methods that exhibit low coupling and high cohesion.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix this violation, try to redesign the type or method to reduce the number of types to which it is coupled.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Exclude this warning when the type or method is still considered maintainable despite its large number of dependencies on other types.
