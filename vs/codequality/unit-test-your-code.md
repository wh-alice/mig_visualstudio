# Unit Test Your Code
Unit tests give developers and testers a quick way to look for logic errors in the methods of classes in [!INCLUDE[csharp_current_short](../codequality/includes/csharp_current_short_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vb_current_short](../codequality/includes/vb_current_short_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[cpp_current_short](../codequality/includes/cpp_current_short_md.md)] projects.  
  
 The unit test tools include:  
  
1.  **Test Explorer.** Test Explorer lets you run unit tests and view their results. Test Explorer can use any unit test framework, including a third-party framework, that has an adapter for the Explorer.  
  
2.  **Microsoft unit test framework for managed code.** The Microsoft unit test framework for managed code is installed with Visual Studio and provides a framework for testing .NET code.  
  
3.  **Microsoft unit test framework for C++.** The Microsoft unit test framework for C++ is installed with Visual Studio and provides a framework for testing native code.  
  
4.  **Code coverage tools.** You can determine the amount of product code that your unit tests exercise from one command in Test Explorer.  
  
5.  **Microsoft Fakes isolation framework.** The Microsoft Fakes isolation framework can create substitute classes and methods for production and system code that create dependencies in the code under test. By implementing the fake delegates for a function, you control the behavior and output of the dependency object.  
  
 You can also use [IntelliTest](../codequality/generate-unit-tests-for-your-code-with-intellitest.md) to explore your .NET code to generate test data and a suite of unit tests. For every statement in the code, a test input is generated that will execute that statement. A case analysis is performed for every conditional branch in the code.  
  
## Key tasks  
 Use the following topics to help with understanding and creating unit tests:

|**Perform stress and performance analysis by using load tests for your unit tests:** You can create a load test and add your unit tests to it to help isolate performance and stress issues in your application. **Note:**  Creating and using load tests requires Visual Studio Enterprise.|-   [Creating and Editing Load Tests](http://msdn.microsoft.com/e2985d15-60a7-4177-93b4-f986c2936337)<br />-   [How to: Add Web Performance Tests and Unit Tests to a Load Test Scenario](http://msdn.microsoft.com/03cc073e-9bdf-4530-ae46-504a51884594)<br />-   [How to: Remove Web Tests and Unit Tests  from a Load Test Scenario](http://msdn.microsoft.com/3d6128d2-82b0-42fc-bda2-23a8aa03be07)|  
|**Set and enforce quality gates:** You can create quality gates to enforce that tests are run before code is checked in to help ensure the quality of the code.|-   [Set and Enforce Quality Gates](../Topic/Set%20and%20Enforce%20Quality%20Gates.md)|  
|**Extend the unit test type:** You can add functionality to your tests that might not be in the Unit Test Framework. For example, you can add a test property that specifies if a test should run as a normal user or not. Or you can extend the framework to add row attributes to a method and use the data in that row inside the test.|For sample code of how to extend the unit test framework, see the following [Microsoft Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=185591).|  
|**Set testing options:** For example, you can specify where test results are stored.|[Configure unit tests by using a .runsettings file](../codequality/configure-unit-tests-by-using-a-.runsettings-file.md)|
