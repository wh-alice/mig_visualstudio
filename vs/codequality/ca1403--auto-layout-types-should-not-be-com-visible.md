# CA1403: Auto layout types should not be COM visible

|TypeName|AutoLayoutTypesShouldNotBeComVisible|  
|CheckId|CA1403|  
|Category|Microsoft.Interoperability|

## Cause  
 A Component Object Model (COM) visible value type is marked with the \<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.StructLayoutAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute set to \<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.LayoutKind?displayProperty=fullName>.  
  
## Rule Description  
 \<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.LayoutKind> layout types are managed by the common language runtime. The layout of these types can change between versions of the .NET Framework, which will break COM clients that expect a specific layout. Note that if the \<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.StructLayoutAttribute> attribute is not specified, the C#, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../codequality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)], and C++ compilers specify the \<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.LayoutKind> layout for value types.  
  
 Unless marked otherwise, all public nongeneric types are visible to COM; all nonpublic and generic types are invisible to COM. However, to reduce false positives, this rule requires the COM visibility of the type to be explicitly stated; the containing assembly must be marked with the \<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisibleAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> set to `false` and the type must be marked with the \<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisibleAttribute> set to `true`.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, change the value of the \<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.StructLayoutAttribute> attribute to \<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.LayoutKind> or \<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.LayoutKind>, or make the type invisible to COM.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows a type that violates the rule and a type that satisfies the rule.
