# Using Rule Sets to Group Code Analysis Rules
When you configure code analysis in [!INCLUDE[vsUltLong](../codequality/includes/vsultlong_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vsPreLong](../codequality/includes/vsprelong_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[vsPro](../codequality/includes/vspro_md.md)], you can choose from a list of Microsoft built-in *rule sets*. A rule set is a logical grouping of code analysis rules that identify targeted issues and specific conditions. For example, you can apply a rule set that is designed to scan code for publicly available APIs, or you can apply a rule set that includes only the minimum recommended rules. You can also apply a rule set that includes all the rules.  
  
 You can customize a rule set by adding or deleting rules, or by changing rules to appear in the **Error List** window as either warnings or errors. Customized rule sets can fulfill a need for your particular development environment. When you customize a rule set, the rule set page provides search and filtering tools to help you in the process.
