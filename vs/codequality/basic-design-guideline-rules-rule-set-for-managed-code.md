# Basic Design Guideline Rules rule set for managed code
You can use the Microsoft Basic Design Guideline Rules rule set to focus on making your code easier to understand and use. You should include this rule set if your project includes library code or if you want to enforce best practices for code that is easy to maintain.  
  
 The Basic Design Guideline Rules include all the rules in the Microsoft Minimum Recommeded Rules rule set. For a list of the minimum rules, see [Managed Recommended Rules rule set for managed code](../codequality/managed-recommended-rules-rule-set-for-managed-code.md).  
  
 The following table describes all of the rules in the Microsoft Basic Design Guideline Rules rule set.
