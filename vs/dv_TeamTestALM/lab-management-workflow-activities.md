# Lab management workflow activities
When you customize a Lab Management workflow template (LabDefaultTemplate.11.xaml), you can use one or more of the pre-defined Lab Management activities. You can also access objects that are created by the Lab Management wizard. This topic describes the [!INCLUDE[esprfound](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/esprfound_md.md)] Lab Management activities and objects that are available when you customize a workflow template to build, deploy, and test your application. For information about how to use these activities in a customized workflow, see [Customizing lab management workflow](../dv_TeamTestALM/customizing-lab-management-workflow.md).  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
-   Visual Studio Enterprise, [!INCLUDE[vstsTestEssLong](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vststestesslong_md.md)]  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_Top"></a> This topic contains the following sections:
