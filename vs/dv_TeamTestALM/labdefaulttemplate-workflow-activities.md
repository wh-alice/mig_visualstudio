# LabDefaultTemplate workflow activities
This topic describes the Windows Workflow activities in the LabDefaultTemplate.11.xaml file. LabDefaultTemplate defines the Lab Management workflow process that enables you build, deploy, and test your application in a lab environment. To learn more about Windows Workflow, see this page [A Developer's Introduction to Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) in .NET 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=200470) on the MSDN website.  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
-   Visual Studio Enterprise, [!INCLUDE[vstsTestEssLong](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vststestesslong_md.md)]  
  
## Initializing the Workflow  
 ![Process root activity](../dv_TeamTestALM/media/lm-ldt-process.png "LM-LDT-Process")  
  
 The root of the LabDefaultTemplate is the TfsBuild.Process activity. This \<xref:System.Activities.ActivityBuilder> initializes the global arguments for the workflow build definition from the input supplied in the Build Definition window and in the Lab Workflow Parameters wizard.  
  
### Arguments  
 The `LabWorkflowParameters` argument contains the data that is supplied in the Lab Workflow Parameters wizard. This argument is a [LabWorkflowDetails](../dv_TeamTestALM/lab-management-workflow-activities.md#BKMK_LabWorkflowDetailsClass) object that contains the following objects:  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|`BuildDetails`|A [BuildDetails](../dv_TeamTestALM/lab-management-workflow-activities.md#BKMK_BuildDetailsObject) object that stores the build details for the build, deploy, and test workflow.|  
|`DeploymentDetails`|A [LabEnvironmentDetails](../dv_TeamTestALM/lab-management-workflow-activities.md#BKMK_LabEnvironmentDetailsObject) object that stores the information that is required for the deployment of a build in the workflow.|  
|`EnvironmentDetails`|A [LabEnvironmentDetails](../dv_TeamTestALM/lab-management-workflow-activities.md#BKMK_LabEnvironmentDetailsObject) object that stores the information that identifies the environment to use for a build, deploy, and test scenario.|  
|`TestParameters`|A [RunTestDetails](../dv_TeamTestALM/lab-management-workflow-activities.md#BKMK_RunTestDetailsObject) object that stores the test parameter details that are required to create the automated test run.|  
  
 The following arguments are also declared at the global scope:  
  
|Argument|Type|  
|--------------|----------|  
|`Metadata`|\<xref:Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Workflow.ProcessParameter>MetadataCollection|  
|**`Verbosity`**|A \<xref:Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Workflow.Verbosity> enumerated value that specifies the amount of information that is written to the log.|  
|`BuildNumberFormat`|A \<xref:System.String> that specifies format of the build number.|  
|`SupportedReasons`|A \<xref:Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Client.BuildReason>enumerated value that specifies the reason for the build.|  
  
## Application Deployment Workflow Sequence  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|![Application deployment workflow](../dv_TeamTestALM/media/lm-ldt-appdeploywf.png "LM-LDT-AppDeployWF")|The **Application Deployment Workflow** sequence controls the entire build, deploy, and test scenario.<br /><br /> **Application Deployment Workflow** declares the following variables:<br /><br /> -   `BuildDetail`: A \<xref:Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Client.IBuildDetail> object.<br />-   `LabEnvironmnetUri`: A \<xref:System.String> that specifies the uri of the environment on which the build is deployed.<br />-   `BuildLocation`: A \<xref:System.String> that specifies the location of the build.<br />-   `SnapshotId`: A \<xref:System.String> that specifies the identifier of a virtual machine snapshot.<br />-   `QueueBuildId`: A \<xref:System.Int32> that specifies the identifier of the build in the queue.|
