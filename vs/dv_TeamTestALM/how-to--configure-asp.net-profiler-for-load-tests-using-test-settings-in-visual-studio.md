# How to: Configure ASP.NET Profiler for Load Tests Using Test Settings in Visual Studio
You can use the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] profiler diagnostic data adapter to collect [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] profiler information. This diagnostic data adapter collects performance data for [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] applications.  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
-   Visual Studio Enterprise  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This diagnostic data adapter cannot be used for tests that are run using [!INCLUDE[TCMext](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/tcmext_md.md)]. You may use the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] Profiler diagnostic adapter with load tests using websites only which requires Visual Studio Enterprise.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] profiler diagnostic data adapter lets you collect [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] profiler data from the application tier when you run a load test. You should not run the profiler for long load tests, for example, load tests that run longer than one hour. This is because the profiler file can become large, perhaps hundreds of megabytes. Instead, run shorter load tests by using the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] profiler, which will still give you the benefit of deep diagnosis of performance problems.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] profiler diagnostic data adapter profiles the Internet Information Services (IIS) process. Therefore, it will not work against a development Web server. To profile the Web site in your load test, you have to install a test agent on the machine on which the IIS is running. The test agent will not generate load, but will be an agent for collection only. For more information, see [Install and configure test agents](../dv_TeamTestALM/install-and-configure-test-agents.md).  
  
 For more information, see [How to: Create a Test Setting for a Distributed Load Test](../dv_TeamTestALM/how-to--create-a-test-setting-for-a-distributed-load-test.md).  
  
 The following procedure describes how to configure the diagnostic data adapter for the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] profiler.  
  
## To Configure the ASP.NET Profiler for Your Test Settings  
 Before you perform the steps in this procedure, you must open your test settings from Visual Studio and select the **Data and Diagnostics** page. [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/crdefault_md.md)][Specifying Test Settings for Visual Studio Tests](../dv_TeamTestALM/specifying-test-settings-for-visual-studio-tests.md).  
  
#### To configure the ASP.NET profiler for your test settings  
  
1.  Select the role to use to collect the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] profiler data.  
  
    > [!CAUTION]
    >  This role must be a Web server.  
  
2.  Select **ASP.NET Profiler** to enable collecting [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] profiling data, and then choose **Configure**.  
  
     The dialog box to configure [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] profiling data collection is displayed.  
  
3.  In **Profiler Sampling interval**, type a value that indicates how many non-halted CPU clock cycles to wait between taking [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] profiling samples.  
  
4.  To enable tier interaction profiling, select **Enable Tier Interaction Profiling**.  
  
     Tier interaction profiling counts the number of requests that are sent to the Web server for each artifact (for example, MyPage.aspx or CompanyLogo.gif) and the time it took to service each request. Additionally, tier interaction profiling collects which ADO.NET connections were used as a part of the page request, and how many queries and stored procedure calls were executed as a part of servicing that request.  
  
     Two different sets of timing information are collected:  
  
    -   The timing information (Min, Max, Average, and Total) for servicing each web request.  
  
    -   The timing information (Min, Max, Average and Total) of executing each query.  
  
 With the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] profiler diagnostic data adapter configured in your test setting, you can now collect [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] profiling data on your [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] Web application. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/crabout_md.md)] how to configure the IIS, the test agent that is required on the IIS machine, and how to test your [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../dv_TeamTestALM/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] web application see [How to: Run a Load Test Containing Web Tests While Collecting ASP.NET Profiler Data](assetId:///7c3363b6-2dec-4cfc-baff-720bca4b61e8).
