# Type Collection Editor Dialog Box
The **Type Collection Editor** dialog box is used to add known types to the **Send** and **Receive** activities. This dialog is also used to add generic type arguments to the **InvokeMethod** activity. When used for the **Send** and **Receive** activities to add known types, the **Type Collection Editor** dialog box requires the type additions to be unique. If a duplicate type is added and the change is committed by clicking **OK**, an error message is returned. When used for the **InvokeMethod** activity to add generic type arguments, the **Type Collection Editor** dialog box allows the addition of duplicate types.  
  
> [!NOTE]
