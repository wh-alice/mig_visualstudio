# Creating Profiler Reports from the Command Line
The **VSPerfReport** command-line tool enables you to create .xml or comma-separated value (.csv) reports from profiling data (.vsp) files. VSPerfReport report types closely match the table-based views of the interface for [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. You can filter the report to show only your code and to show only a segment of the profiling data file. For more information, see [VSPerfReport](../profiling/vsperfreport.md).  
  
 You can also make your profiling data files easier to share by embedding symbols in the .vsp files and by creating pre-analyzed report (.vsps) files that are smaller and quicker to open.  
  
## Common Tasks  
  
|Task|Related Content|  
|----------|---------------------|  
|**Create a basic report.** Create all or a subset of the VSPerfReport report types.|-   [Creating Basic Reports](../profiling/creating-basic-profiling-reports-from-the-command-line.md)|  
|**Compare two profiling data files.** Create a "diff" report that compares performance data in two profiling data files.|-   [How to: Create a Profiler Comparison Report from a Command Prompt](../profiling/how-to-create-a-profiler-comparison-report-from-a-command-prompt.md)|  
|**View call trace and Event Trace for Windows (ETW) data.** Create a call trace report that lists timing information for each entry and exit point to your application's functions and each call to other functions by your function. Or create a detailed listing of all ETW events that were collected in a profiling run.|-   [How to: Create a Call Trace Report](../profiling/how-to-create-a-profiling-tools-call-trace-report.md)|  
|**Filter a report.** Limit a report to only the functions in your code or to a specific time in the profiling data file.|-   [How to: Filter Reports from the Command Line](../profiling/how-to-filter-reports-from-the-command-line.md)|  
|**Create portable profiling data files.** To make sharing of profiling data easier, you can embed the symbols for a profiling run into the .vsp file. You can also create a pre-analyzed profiling data (.vsps) file that is smaller and quicker to open.|-   [Creating Portable Profiling Data Files](../profiling/creating-portable-profiling-data-files-from-the-command-line.md)|
