# Disk Operations Report (Threads View)
The Disk Operations Report shows disk I/O operations in the disk channels.

-   The name and PID of the process that performed the disk access  
  
-   The ID of the thread that accessed the disk  
  
-   The name of the file that was accessed  
  
-   The number of reads per file  
  
-   The number of bytes read  
  
-   The read latency, in milliseconds  
  
-   The number of writes  
  
-   The number of bytes written  
  
-   The write latency, in milliseconds
