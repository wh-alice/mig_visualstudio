# Performance Explorer Window
The **Performance Explorer** window in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE) enables you to configure and start performance sessions by using the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools.  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[vsUltLong](../code-quality/includes/vsultlong_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vsPreLong](../code-quality/includes/vsprelong_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vsPro](../code-quality/includes/vspro_md.md)]  
  
## Performance Explorer Toolbar  
 The following options are available on the **Performance Explorer** toolbar:  
  
-   **Launch Performance Wizard** - Displays the Performance Wizard to add a new performance session to the Performance Explorer window.  
  
-   **New Performance Session** - Adds an empty performance session to the Performance Explorer window.  
  
-   **Launch** - The **Launch** command button list enables you to start the target application that has profiling immediately enabled (**Launch with profiling**) or with profiling suspended (**Launch with profiling paused**).  
  
-   **Method** - Specifies whether the profiling method of the session is sampling or instrumentation.  
  
-   **Stop** - Immediately exits the target application and the profiler.  
  
-   **Attach/Detach** - Displays the **Attach Profiler to Process** dialog box to select a running process to which to attach the profiler.  
  
## Performance Explorer Window  
 The **Performance Explorer** window contains a tree control that displays the binaries and report data files of one or more performance sessions.  
  
-   **Session Name** - The root of the tree control contains the name of the session. Right-click the session name to set the session properties or to start the target application and profiler.  
  
-   **Targets** - Displays the names of binaries that are to be profiled in the session. Right-click **Targets** to add or remove a binary, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project, or Web site. Right-click a target name to set properties for the individual binary.  
  
-   **Reports** - Displays the names of profiler data files that are generated for the session. Right-click **Reports** to add an existing report or compare two profiler data files. Right-click a report name to open, remove, or export a profiler data file.
