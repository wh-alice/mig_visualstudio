# Collecting Application Statistics for ASP.NET Web Applications Using the Profiler Sampling Method from the Command Line
This section describes the procedures and options for collecting performance statistics for an ASP.NET Web application by using the **VSPerfASPNETCmd** and **VSPerfCmd** command-line tool and the sampling profiling method.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Enhanced security features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 required significant changes in the way the Visual Studio profiler collects data on these platforms. Windows Store apps also require new collection techniques. See [Performance Tools on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../profiling/performance-tools-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012-applications.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Although the **VSPerfCmd** tool gives you complete access to Profiling Tools functionality, including pausing and resuming profiling, and collecting additional data from processor and Windows performance counters, you should use use the  **VSPerfASPNETCmd** command line tool when you do not need this functionality. The **VSPerfASPNETCmd** command line tool is the preferred method when your are profiling ASP.NET Web sites using the stand-alone profiler. Compared with the [VSPerfCmd](../profiling/vsperfcmd.md) command line tool, no environment variables need to be set, and rebooting the computer is not required. For more information, see [Rapid Web Site Profiling with VSPerfASPNETCmd](../profiling/rapid-web-site-profiling-with-vsperfaspnetcmd.md).
