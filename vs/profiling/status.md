# Status
The VSPerfCmd.exe **Status** option displays information about the state of the profiler and any processes that are currently being profiled.  
  
 The **Status** option must be the only option specified on the command line. The profiler must be initialized with the VSPerfCmd.exe **Start** option before any status can be displayed.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
VSPerfCmd.exe /Status  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 None  
  
## Remarks  
 The **Status** option displays the following state information for the profiler.  
  
 **Output File Name**  
 The path and file name of the current profiler data file.  
  
 **Collection Mode**  
 SAMPLE or TRACE  
  
 **Maximum Processes**  
 The maximum number of processes that can be profiled at one time and the number of currently active processes.  
  
 **Maximum Threads**  
 The maximum number of threads that can be profiled at one time.  
  
 **Number of Buffers**
