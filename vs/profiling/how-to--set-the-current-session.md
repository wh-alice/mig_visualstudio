# How to: Set the Current Session
You can open multiple performance sessions in the **Performance Explorer**, and can then select one of the visible performance sessions to be set as the current session.  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[vsUltLong](../code-quality/includes/vsultlong_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vsPreLong](../code-quality/includes/vsprelong_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vsPro](../code-quality/includes/vspro_md.md)]  
  
 After you set a session as the current session, clicking **Launch** on the **Performance Explorer** toolbar will start profiling the current session.  
  
### To set current performance session  
  
-   In **Performance Explorer**, right-click the performance session, and then click **Set as Current Session**.  
  
     The session name appears in bold.
