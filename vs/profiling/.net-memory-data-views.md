# .NET Memory Data Views
This section contains reference information for the views and reports of profiler data files that contains .NET memory profiling data.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Summary View](../profiling/summary-view---.net-memory-data.md)  
 Lists the functions and types that allocated the most memory.  
  
 [Allocations View](../profiling/.net-memory-allocations-view.md)  
 Lists the types that were allocated in the profiling run, and the call trees (execution paths) that resulted in the allocation of the type.  
  
 [Object Lifetime View](../profiling/object-lifetime-view.md)  
 Lists the types that were allocated in the profiling run, and the number of instances, size in bytes, and the garbage collection generation of the type.  
  
 [Call Tree View - Sampling](../profiling/call-tree-view---.net-memory-sampling-data.md)  
 Displays a hierarchical tree that represents the execution paths and memory allocation data of functions in the profiling run.  
  
 [Modules View - Sampling](../profiling/modules-view---.net-memory-sampling-data.md)  
 Organizes .NET memory allocation data by module, and lists the functions, source code lines, and instructions that were executing when memory was allocated.  
  
 [Caller/Callee View - .NET Memory Sampling Data](../profiling/caller-callee-view---.net-memory-sampling-data.md)  
 Lists memory allocation data for a selected function, the functions that called the selected function, and the functions that were called by the selected function.  
  
 [Functions View - Sampling](../profiling/functions-view---.net-memory-sampling-data.md)  
 Lists memory allocation data for the functions in the profiling run.  
  
 [Lines View - Sampling](../profiling/lines-view---.net-memory-sampling-data.md)  
 Lists memory allocation data for the source code lines of functions in the profiling run.  
  
 [Instruction Pointers (IPs) View - Sampling](../profiling/instruction-pointers--ips--view---.net-memory-sampling-data.md)  
 Lists memory allocation data for the instructions of functions in the profiling run.  
  
 [Call Tree View - Instrumentation](../profiling/call-tree-view---.net-memory-instrumentation-data.md)  
 Displays a hierarchical tree that represents the execution paths, memory allocation data, and detailed timing data for instrumented functions in the profiling run.  
  
 [Modules View - Instrumentation](../profiling/modules-view---.net-memory-instrumentation-data.md)  
 Organizes profiling data by module, and lists the functions, memory allocation data, and detailed timing information for the module.  
  
 [Caller/Callee View - NET Memory Instrumentation Data](../profiling/caller-callee-view---net-memory-instrumentation-data.md)  
 Lists memory allocation data and detailed timing information for a selected instrumented function, the functions that called the selected function, and the functions that were called by the selected function.  
  
 [Functions View - Instrumentation](../profiling/functions-view---.net-memory-instrumentation-data.md)  
 Lists memory allocation data for the instrumented functions in the profiling run.  
  
## Reference  
 [Function Details View](../profiling/function-details-view.md)  
 Displays a graphical chart of the relationship between a selected function and the functions that called and were called by the selected function.  
  
 [Process View](../profiling/process-view.md)  
 Lists process and thread start and end times.  
  
 [Marks View](../profiling/marks-view.md)  
 Lists ETW and sampling events that were inserted into a profiling data file.
