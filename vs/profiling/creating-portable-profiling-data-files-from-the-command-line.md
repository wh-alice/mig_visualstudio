# Creating Portable Profiling Data Files from the Command Line
To make sharing of profiling data easier, you can use the [VSPerfReport](../profiling/vsperfreport.md) command-line tool to embed the symbols for a profiling run into the .vsp file.  
  
 You can also create a pre-analyzed profiling data (.vsps) file that is smaller and is quicker to load in the IDE.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Make sure the symbol (.pdb) files are available to **VSPerfReport**. For more information, see [How to: Specify Symbol File Locations from the Command Line](../profiling/how-to--specify-symbol-file-locations-from-the-command-line.md).  
>   
>  For information about the path to **VSReport**, see [Specifying the Path to Command Line Tools](../profiling/specifying-the-path-to-profiling-tools-command-line-tools.md).  
>   
>  The profiling data in a .vsps file cannot be filtered.  
  
### To embed the symbols for a profiling run into a profiling data (.vsp) file  
  
-   At a command prompt window, type the following command:  
  
     \<Path>**VSPerfReport \<**VSP File> **/PackSymbols**  
  
     By default, the .vsps file is named with the base name of the .vsp file. You can specify an alternative name by using the **Output** option.  
  
### To create a summary profiling data file  
  
-   At a command prompt window, type the following command:  
  
     \<Path>**VSPerfReport \<**VSP File> **/SummaryFile** [**/Output:**\<File Name>]  
  
     By default, the .vsps file is named with the base name of the .vsp file. You can specify an alternative name by using the **Output** option.
