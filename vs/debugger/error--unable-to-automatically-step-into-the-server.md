# Error: Unable to Automatically Step Into the Server
The error reads:  
  
 Unable to Automatically Step Into the Server. The debugger was not notified before the remote procedure was executed  
  
 This error can occur when you are trying to step into a web service (see [Stepping Into an XML Web Service](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/8e67de38-bf5f-41cc-a457-1b88ce63d764)). It can occur whenever [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] is not set up properly.  
  
 Possible causes are:  
  
-   The web.config file for your [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] application does not set debug to "true" in (see [Debug Mode in ASP.NET Applications](../debugger/how-to--enable-debugging-for-asp.net-applications.md)).  
  
-   A version of [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] was installed after Visual Studio was installed. [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] should be installed before Visual Studio. To fix this problem, use the Windows **Control Panel**, **Programs and Features** to repair your Visual Studio installation.
