# Debugging Preparation: Windows Forms Applications
The Windows Forms project template creates a Windows Forms application. Debugging this type of application in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] is straightforward. For more information, see [Creating a Windows Application Project](assetId:///b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa).  
  
 When you create a Windows Forms project with the project template, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] automatically creates required settings for the Debug and Release configurations. If necessary, you can change these settings. These settings can be changed in the **\<project name> Property Pages** dialog box (**My Project** in Visual Basic).  
  
 For more information, see [Recommended Property Settings](../debugger/managed-debugging--recommended-property-settings.md).  
  
 The following table displays one additional recommended property setting.  
  
### Configuration Properties in Debug tab  
  
|**Property Name**|**Setting**|  
|-----------------------|-----------------|  
|**Start Action**|-   Set to **Start project,** most of the time. Set to **Start external program** if you want to start another executable when you start debugging (usually for debugging DLLs).|  
  
 You can debug Windows Forms applications from inside [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], or by attaching to an already running application. For more information about attaching, see [Attach to Running Processes](../debugger/attach-to-running-processes-with-the-visual-studio-debugger.md).  
  
### To debug a C#, F#, or Visual Basic Windows Forms application  
  
1.  Open the project in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  
  
2.  Create breakpoints as needed.  
  
     Because Windows Forms applications are event-driven, your breakpoints will go into event handler code, or into methods called by event handler code. Typical events in which to place breakpoints include:  
  
    1.  Events associated with a control, such as Click, Enter, etc.  
  
    2.  Events associated with application startup and shutdown, such as Load, Activated, etc.  
  
    3.  Focus and Validation Events.  
  
     For more information, see [Creating Event Handlers in Windows Forms](../Topic/Creating%20Event%20Handlers%20in%20Windows%20Forms.md).  
  
3.  On the **Debug** menu, click **Start**.  
  
4.  Debug using the techniques discussed in [Debugger Basics](../debugger/debugger-basics.md).
