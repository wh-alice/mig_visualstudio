# CV_access_e
Specifies the scope of visibility (access level) of member functions and variables.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
typedef enum CV_access_e {   
   CV_private   = 1,  
   CV_protected = 2,  
   CV_public    = 3  
} CV_access_e;  
```  
  
## Elements  
 CV_private  
 Member has private access.  
  
 CV_protected  
 Member has protected access.  
  
 CV_public  
 Member has public access.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `friend` access specifier is not included here because it is typically used by non-member functions that have access to both private and protected elements of the class. Use the [IDiaSymbol::get_symTag](../debugger/idiasymbol--get_symtag.md) method to find symbols with `SymTagFriend` access.
