# Error: Unable to initiate DCOM communication
A DCOM error occurred when the local machine tried to communicate with the remote machine. This is caused by a firewall on the remote server or broken Windows authentication on the remote machine.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   If the remote machine has Windows Firewall enabled, see [Set Up the Remote Tools on the Device](../Topic/Set%20Up%20the%20Remote%20Tools%20on%20the%20Device.md) for instructions about how to configure the firewall for local debugging.  
  
-   To restore Windows authentication, try rebooting both machines. Examine event logs on local and remote machines for Kerberos errors and contact domain administrators for known problems.
