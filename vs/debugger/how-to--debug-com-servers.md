# How to: Debug COM Servers
Debugging COM server applications poses a unique set of problems that are not always easy to solve.  
  
 If you do not have or do not want to use debugging information for your container application, starting to debug the server application is a three-step process.  
  
### To debug a server application without container information  
  
1.  Start debugging the server as a normal application.  
  
2.  Set breakpoints as desired.  
  
3.  Start the container application.
