# How Can I Find Out If My Pointers Corrupt a Memory Address?
## Problem Description  
 I think that one of my pointers may be corrupting memory at address 0x00408000. How can I find out what is happening there?  
  
## Solution  
  
#### Check for heap corruption  
  
-   Most memory corruption is actually due to heap corruption. Try using the Global Flags Utility (gflags.exe) or pageheap.exe. See [http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;286470](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;286470).  
  
#### To find where the memory address is modified  
  
1.  Set a data breakpoint at 0x00408000. See [Set a data change breakpoint (native C++ only)](../debugger/using-breakpoints.md#BKMK_Set_a_data_change_breakpoint__native_C___only_).  
  
2.  When you hit the breakpoint, use the **Memory** window to view memory contents starting at 0x00408000. For more information, see [Memory Windows](../debugger/memory-windows.md).
