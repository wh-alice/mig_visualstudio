# Resolve Ambiguity Dialog Box
The `Resolve Ambiguity` dialog box appears when the debugger cannot choose the location to display. For example, if you are using C++ templates, you can create multiple functions from a single function template. If the debugger stops at a source location in the template, and you choose `Go To Disassembly`, the debugger has multiple options. Each function created from the template has its own disassembly code, and the debugger does not know which code you want to view. The `Resolve Ambiguity` dialog box enables you to select the location you want from a list of all corresponding locations.  
  
 `Choose the specific location`  
 Lists all the locations corresponding to your command.  
  
 `Address`  
 Shows the memory addresses for each function.  
  
 `Function`  
 Shows the name of each function.  
  
 `Module`  
 Shows the module (EXE or DLL) containing the object code for the function.
