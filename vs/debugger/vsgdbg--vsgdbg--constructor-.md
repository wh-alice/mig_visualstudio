# VsgDbg::VsgDbg (Constructor)
Constructs an instance of the `VsgDbg` class with or without preparing the in-app component of graphics diagnostics to actively capture and record graphics information by default, based on the specified Boolean parameter.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
VsgDbg(  
  bDefaultInit  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `bDefaultInit`  
 `true` to specify that the in-app component of graphics diagnostics is to be prepared to actively capture and record graphics information; `false` to specify that the app should not be prepared to actively capture and record graphics information at this time.  
  
## Remarks  
 When the constructor is called with `bDefaultInit` set to `true`, the file name of the graphics log file is determined by how the `DONT_SAVE_VSGLOG_TO_TEMP` and `VSG_DEFAULT_RUN_FILENAME` preprocessor symbols are defined before `vsgcapture.h` is included in your app.  
  
 When the constructor is called with `bDefaultInit` set to `false`, the in-app component of graphics diagnostics can be prepared to actively capture and record graphics information at a later time by calling the `Init` function.
