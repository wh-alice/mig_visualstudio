# How to: Flag and Unflag Threads
You can flag a thread that you want to give special attention by marking it with an icon in the **Threads**, **Parallel Stacks**, **Parallel Watch**, and **GPU Threads** windows. This icon can help you and others distinguish flagged threads from other threads.  
  
 Flagged threads also receive special treatment in the **Thread** list on the **Debug Location** toolbar. This list can show all threads or only flagged threads. When you flag a thread, the **Thread** list automatically switches to show only flagged threads, but you can switch it back to show all threads as appropriate.  
  
### To flag or unflag a thread by using the Threads window  
  
-   In the **Threads** window, find the thread you are interested in and click the flag icon to select or clear the flag.  
  
### To unflag all threads  
  
-   In the **Threads** window, right-click any thread and then click **Unflag All Threads**.  
  
### To display only flagged threads  
  
-   Choose the flag button in the debugging window.  
  
### To flag Just My Code  
  
1.  On the toolbar at the top of the **Threads** window, click the flag icon.  
  
2.  In the drop-down list, click **Flag Just My Code**.  
  
### To flag threads that are associated with selected modules  
  
1.  On the toolbar of the **Threads** window, click the flag icon.  
  
2.  In the drop-down list, click **Flag Custom Module Selection**.  
  
3.  In the **Select Modules** dialog box, select the modules that you want.  
  
4.  (Optional) In the **Search** box, type a string to search for specific modules.  
  
5.  Click **OK**.
