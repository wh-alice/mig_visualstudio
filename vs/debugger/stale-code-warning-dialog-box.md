# Stale Code Warning Dialog Box
This dialog box appears when you have made changes to native code that **Edit and Continue** could not immediately apply. As a result, some native code in the current stack frame is now out of date, that is, stale. For more information, see [How to: Work with Stale Code](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c7536e95-66a6-44a0-995d-3fe5035250b4).  
  
 **Don't show me this dialog again**  
 If you select this check box, Edit and Continue will apply code changes without asking permission in the future. You can turn this warning on again by going to the **Options** dialog box, opening the **Debugging** Folder, clicking the **Edit and Continue** page, and selecting **Warn about stale code**.
