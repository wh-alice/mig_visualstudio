# Debugging Preparation: C#, F#, and Visual Basic Project Types
The topics in this section describe how to debug the C#, F#, and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] project types created by the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project templates.  
  
 Note that those project types that create DLLs as their output have been grouped into [Debugging DLL Projects](../debugger/debugging-dll-projects.md) because of the common features they share.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Recommended Property Settings](../debugger/managed-debugging--recommended-property-settings.md)  
 This section describes the recommended debugging-related property settings for C#, F#, and Visual Basic projects.  
  
 [Windows Forms Applications](../debugger/debugging-preparation--windows-forms-applications.md)  
 Describes a Windows Application project and provides instructions for debugging, changing the default Debug configuration, and starting the application outside of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and attaching to it.  
  
 [Console Projects](../debugger/debugging-preparation--console-projects.md)  
 Provides additional considerations for debugging C# or [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] console applications. This includes specifying command-line arguments, starting your application from the command prompt, writing to the Output window, and troubleshooting the Console window.  
  
 [Windows Services](../debugger/debugging-preparation--windows-services.md)  
 Describes a Windows service and provides a link to Debugging Windows Service Applications.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Debugger Settings and Preparation](../debugger/debugger-settings-and-preparation.md)  
 Covers the settings and preparation that you must perform to debug your program with the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] debugger.  
  
 [Debugging Managed Code](../debugger/debugging-managed-code.md)  
 Covers common debugging problems and techniques for applications written in managed code.
