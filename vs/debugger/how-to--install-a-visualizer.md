# How to: Install a Visualizer
After you have created a visualizer, you must install the visualizer so that it will be available in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. Installing a visualizer is a simple process.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In **Store** apps, only the standard text, HTML, XML, and JSON visualizers are supported. Custom (user-created) visualizers are not supported.  
  
### To install a visualizer  
  
1.  Locate the DLL that contains the visualizer you have built.  
  
2.  Copy the DLL to either of the following locations:  
  
    -   *VisualStudioInstallPath* `\Common7\Packages\Debugger\Visualizers`  
  
    -   `My Documents\` *VisualStudioVersion* `\Visualizers`  
  
3.  If you want to use a managed visualizer for remote debugging, copy the DLL to the same path on the remote computer.  
  
4.  Restart the debugging session.
