# Debugging Preparation: Windows Services
A Windows service is a program that runs in the background under Microsoft Windows. Examples include the Telnet service and the Windows time service, which updates your computer's visible clock. A Windows service cannot be run from within [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]; it must run within the context of the Services Control Manager. For more information, see [Creating Windows Services](../Topic/How%20to:%20Create%20Windows%20Services.md), [Debugging Windows Service Applications](../Topic/How%20to:%20Debug%20Windows%20Service%20Applications.md), and [Windows Service Applications](../Topic/Developing%20Windows%20Service%20Applications.md).
