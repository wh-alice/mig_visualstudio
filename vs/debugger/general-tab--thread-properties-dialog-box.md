# General Tab, Thread Properties Dialog Box
Use this dialog box to find out more about a specific thread. To display this dialog box, move the focus to a [Threads View](../debugger/threads-view.md) window, or open [Messages View](../debugger/messages-view.md) and expand a message. Select any thread node in the tree, then choose **Properties** from the **View** menu.  
  
 The **Thread Properties** dialog box contains one pane, the **General** tab. The following settings are available:  
  
|Entry|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**Module Name**|The name of the module.|  
|**Thread ID**|The unique ID of this thread. Note that thread ID numbers are reused; they identify a thread only for the lifetime of that thread.|  
|**Process ID**|The unique ID of this process. Process ID numbers are reused, so they identify a process only for the lifetime of that process. The Process object type is created when a program is run. All the threads in a process share the same address space and have access to the same data. Choose this value to view the properties of the process ID.|  
|**Thread State**|The current state of the thread. A Running thread is using a processor; a Standby thread is about to use one. A Ready Thread is waiting to use a processor because one is not free. A thread in Transition is waiting for a resource to execute, such as waiting for its execution stack to be paged in from disk. A Waiting thread does not need the processor because it is waiting for a peripheral operation to complete or a resource to become free.|  
|**Wait Reason**|This is applicable only when the thread is in the Wait state. Event Pairs are used to communicate with protected subsystems.|  
|**CPU Time**|Total CPU time spent on this process and its threads. Equal to User Time + Privileged Time.|  
|**User Time**|The total elapsed time that this thread has spent executing code in User Mode. Applications execute in User Mode, as do subsystems like the window manager and the graphics engine.|  
|**Privileged Time**|The total elapsed time that this thread has spent executing code in Privileged Mode. When a Windows system service is called, the service will often run in Privileged Mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in User Mode. Calls to the system may be explicit, or they may be implicit, such as when a page fault or an interrupt occurs.|  
|**Elapsed Time**|The total elapsed time (in seconds) this thread has been running.|  
|**Current Priority**|The current dynamic priority of this thread. Threads within a process can raise and lower their own base priority relative to the base priority of the process.|  
|**Base Priority**|The current base priority of this thread.|  
|**Start Address**|Starting virtual address for this thread.|  
|**User PC**|The user program counter for the thread.|  
|**Context Switches**|The number of switches from one thread to another. Thread switches can occur either inside a single process or across processes. A thread switch may be caused by one thread asking another for information, or by a thread being preempted when a higher priority thread becomes ready to run.|
