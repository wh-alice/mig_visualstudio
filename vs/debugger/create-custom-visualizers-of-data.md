# Create Custom Visualizers of Data
Visualizers are components of the [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../code-quality/includes/vs_current_short_md.md)] debugger user interface. A *visualizer* creates a dialog box or another interface to display a variable or object in a manner that is appropriate to its data type. For example, an HTML visualizer interprets an HTML string and displays the result as it would appear in a browser window; a bitmap visualizer interprets a bitmap structure and displays the graphic it represents. Some visualizers enable you to modify as well as view the data.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../code-quality/includes/vs_current_short_md.md)] debugger includes six standard visualizers. These are the text, HTML, XML, and JSON visualizers, all of which work on string objects; the WPF Tree visualizer, for displaying the properties of a WPF object visual tree; and the dataset visualizer, which works for DataSet, DataView, and DataTable objects. Additional visualizers may be available for download from Microsoft Corporation in the future, and are available from third-parties and the community. In addition, you can write your own visualizers and install them in the [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../code-quality/includes/vs_current_short_md.md)] debugger.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In **Store** apps, only the standard text, HTML, XML, and JSON visualizers are supported. Custom (user-created) visualizers are not supported.  
  
 Visualizers are represented in the debugger by a magnifying glass icon. When you see the magnifying glass icon in a **DataTip**, in a debugger variables window, or in the **QuickWatch** dialog box, you can click the magnifying glass to select a visualizer appropriate to the data type of the corresponding object.  
  
 Visualizers are not supported on the Compact Framework.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Debugger visualizers require greater privileges than are allowed by a partial trust application. As a result, visualizers do not load when you are stopped in code with partial trust. To debug using a visualizer, you must run the code with full trust.
