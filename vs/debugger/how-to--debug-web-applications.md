# How to: Debug Web Applications
[!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] is the primary technology for developing Web applications in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] debugger provides powerful tools for debugging [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] Web applications locally or on a remote server. This topic describes how to debug a [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] project during development. For information about how to debug a [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] Web application already deployed on a production server, see [Debugging Deployed Web Applications](../debugger/debugging-deployed-web-applications.md).  
  
 To debug a [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] application:  
  
-   You must have required permissions. For more information, see [System Requirements](../debugger/asp.net-debugging--system-requirements.md).  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] debugging must be enabled in **Project Properties**.  
  
-   The configuration file of your application (Web.config) must be set to debug mode. Debug mode causes [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] to generate symbols for dynamically generated files and enables the debugger to attach to the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] application. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] sets this automatically when you start to debug, if you created your project from the Web projects template.  
  
-   For more information, see [How to: Enable Debugging for ASP.NET Applications](../debugger/how-to--enable-debugging-for-asp.net-applications.md).  
  
### To debug a Web application during development  
  
1.  On the **Debug** menu, click **Start** to begin debugging the Web application.  
  
     [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] builds the Web application project, deploys the application if necessary, starts the ASP.NET Development Server if you are debugging locally, and attaches to the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] worker process.  
  
2.  Use the Debugger to set and clear breakpoints, step, and perform other debugging operations, as you would for any application.  
  
     For more information, see [Debugger Basics](../debugger/debugger-basics.md).  
  
3.  On the **Debug** menu, click **Stop Debugging** to end the debugging session, or, on the **File** menu in Internet Explorer, click **Close**.
