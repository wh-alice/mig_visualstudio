# Class Tab, Window Properties Dialog Box
Use the **Class** tab to show information on the class of the selected window. To display the [Window Properties Dialog Box](../debugger/window-properties-dialog-box.md), move the focus to the [Windows View](../debugger/windows-view.md) window. Select any window node in the tree, then choose **Properties** from the **View** menu.  
  
 The following settings are available on the **Class** tab:
