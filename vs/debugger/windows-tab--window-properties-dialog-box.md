# Windows Tab, Window Properties Dialog Box
Use the **Windows** tab to show information on windows related to the selected window. To display the [Window Properties Dialog Box](../debugger/window-properties-dialog-box.md), move the focus to the [Windows View](../debugger/windows-view.md) window. Select any window node in the tree, then choose **Properties** from the **View** menu.  
  
 The following settings are available on the **Windows** tab:  
  
|Entry|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**Next Window**|The handle of the next sibling window in the same sequence (Z-order) shown in the window tree view ("none" if there is no next window). Choose this entry to view the properties of the next window.|  
|**Previous Window**|The handle of the previous sibling window in the same sequence (Z-order) shown in the window tree view ("none" if there is no previous window). Choose this entry to view the properties of the previous window.|  
|**Parent Window**|The handle of this window's parent window ("none" if there is no parent). Choose this entry to view the properties of the parent window.|  
|**First Child**|The handle of this window's first child window, in the sequence (Z-order) shown in the window tree view ("none" if there are no child windows). Choose this value to view the properties of the first child window.|  
|**Owner Window**|The handle of this window's owner window. An application's main window typically owns system-modal dialog windows, for example ("none" if there is no owner). Choose this entry to view the properties of the owner window.|
