# Debug Hook Function Writing
This section describes a number of custom debug hook functions you can write that allow you to insert your code into some predefined points inside the debugger's normal processing.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Client Block Hook Functions](../debugger/client-block-hook-functions.md)  
 Provides guidance and a prototype for writing functions that validate or report the contents of the data stored in _CLIENT_BLOCK blocks.  
  
 [Allocation Hook Functions](../debugger/allocation-hook-functions.md)  
 Defines an allocation hook function, explores its different uses, points out restrictions, and provides a prototype.  
  
 [Allocation Hooks and CRT Memory Allocations](../debugger/allocation-hooks-and-c-run-time-memory-allocations.md)  
 Describes the restriction on allocation hook functions of explicitly ignoring `_CRT_BLOCK` blocks if they make any calls to C run-time library functions that allocate internal memory. This topic also lists the consequences if your allocation hook does not ignore `_CRT_BLOCK` blocks (with examples) and how to change the default allocation hook function, **CrtDefaultAllocHook**.  
  
 [Report Hook Functions](../debugger/report-hook-functions.md)  
 Discusses `_CrtSetReportHook`, which you can use to filter reports to focus on specific types of allocations. This topic also provides a prototype.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [CRT Debugging Techniques](../debugger/crt-debugging-techniques.md)  
 Links to debugging techniques for the C Run-Time Library, including using the CRT Debug Library, macros for reporting, differences between `malloc` and `_malloc_dbg`, writing debug hook functions, and the CRT debug heap.
