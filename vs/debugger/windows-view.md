# Windows View
When you first open Spy++, Windows view displays a tree of all windows and controls in the system. The window handle and class name are shown. The current desktop window is at the top of the tree. All other windows are children of the desktop, and are listed according to the standard window hierarchy. Sibling windows appear in expansible lists indented below their parents.  
  
 The figure below shows a typical Spy++ Windows view with the top node expanded.

Spy++ Windows View  
  
 The current desktop window is at the top of the tree. All other windows are children of the desktop, and are listed according to the standard window hierarchy, with sibling windows ordered by Z-order. You can expand or collapse any parent node of the tree by clicking the + or - symbol next to the node.  
  
 When Windows view has the focus, you can use the Finder tool in the [Window Search Dialog Box](../debugger/window-search-dialog-box.md) to display information from any window open on your system.
