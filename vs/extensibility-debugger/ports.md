# Ports
In terms of the debugger architecture, a **port**:  
  
-   Is a container for a set of processes running on a server. For example, a port might represent a connection to a Windows CE-based device by a serial cable, or to a networked non-DCOM machine. One special port, called the local port, contains all the processes running on the local machine.  
  
-   Can identify itself by name or identifier.  
  
-   Can enumerate all processes running on the port and launch and terminate these processes.  
  
-   Is represented by an [IDebugPort2](../extensibility-debugger-reference/idebugport2.md) interface, which is created by passing an [IDebugPortRequest2](../extensibility-debugger-reference/idebugportrequest2.md) argument to [AddPort](../extensibility-debugger-reference/idebugportsupplier2--addport.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] supplies a default port that handles all Windows-based processes, native and managed. A custom port must be implemented for connections with external devices that are not Windows-based. To supply such custom ports, a custom port supplier also needs to be implemented.
