# Debugger Contexts
In [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] debugging, the debug engine (DE) operates simultaneously within several distinct contexts, as follows:  
  
-   The code context, which describes the current location in a program's execution stream.  
  
-   The documentation context or position, which describes the current position within a source document.  
  
-   The expression evaluation context, which describes the context in which expression evaluation will take place.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Code Context](../extensibility-debugger/code-context.md)  
 Discusses code context as an address in a program's instruction stream in today's run-time architectures versus nontraditional languages, where code may not be represented by instructions, but some other means.  
  
 [Document Position](../extensibility-debugger/document-position.md)  
 Defines document position in Visual Studio debugging by means of an abstraction of a position in a source file as known to the IDE.  
  
 [Document Context](../extensibility-debugger/document-context.md)  
 Discusses what document context represents in Visual Studio debugging in relation to a source file. Also discusses how the symbol handler maps a code context to documentation context.  
  
 [Expression Evaluation Context](../extensibility-debugger/expression-evaluation-context.md)  
 Provides information on an expression evaluation context in Visual Studio. For example, an expression evaluation context associated with a stack frame provides the context for evaluating local variables, method parameters, and class members.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Debugging Concepts](../extensibility-debugger/debugger-concepts.md)  
 Describes the main debugging architectural concepts.  
  
 [Debugging Components](../extensibility-debugger/debugger-components.md)  
 Provides an overview of the Visual Studio debugging components, which include the debug engine (DE), expression evaluator (EE), and symbol handler (SH).  
  
 [Debugging Tasks](../extensibility-debugger/debugging-tasks.md)  
 Contains links to various debugging tasks, such as launching a program and evaluating expressions.
