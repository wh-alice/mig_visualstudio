# Threads
In terms of the debugger architecture, a **thread**:  
  
-   Is the fundamental unit of computation. A thread sequentially executes its instructions within the context of a single call stack, moving from one code context to the next.  
  
-   Can identify itself and the program it is running in, and can be named, suspended, and resumed. A thread can also enumerate its associated stack frames and, under some conditions, can be moved to another stack frame. Given the context of a stack frame, a thread can return its associated logical thread, if any. A thread has properties, such as a suspend count, that can be displayed in the Threads window of the IDE.  
  
-   Is represented by an [IDebugThread2](../extensibility-debugger-reference/idebugthread2.md) interface, typically created by a debug engine (DE) or virtual machine as a consequence of executing a program.
