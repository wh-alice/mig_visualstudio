# Debugger Concepts
To build on the Visual Studio debug package, you need to be familiar with the architectural concepts used in designing the package.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Debug Session](../extensibility-debugger/debug-session.md)  
 Explains the role of a session in the debugging architecture.  
  
 [Servers](../extensibility-debugger/servers--visual-studio-sdk-.md)  
 Defines what a server is in terms of debugging architecture, in both abstract and physical terms.  
  
 [Port Suppliers](../extensibility-debugger/port-suppliers.md)  
 Defines what a port supplier is in terms of debugging architecture.  
  
 [Ports](../extensibility-debugger/ports.md)  
 Defines what a port is in terms of debugging architecture.  
  
 [Processes](../extensibility-debugger/processes.md)  
 Defines what a process is in terms of debugging architecture.  
  
 [Program Nodes](../extensibility-debugger/program-nodes.md)  
 Defines a program node in terms of debugging architecture, including how it can identify itself and the process it is running in.  
  
 [Programs](../extensibility-debugger/programs.md)  
 Defines a program in terms of debugging architecture.  
  
 [Threads](../extensibility-debugger/threads.md)  
 Defines the characteristics of threads in terms of debugging architecture.  
  
 [Stack Frames](../extensibility-debugger/stack-frames.md)  
 Defines a stack frame in terms of debugging architecture. A stack frame is an abstraction of a stack that provides the execution context of a thread.  
  
 [Modules](../extensibility-debugger/modules.md)  
 Defines a module, in terms of debugging architecture, as a physical container of code, such as an executable file or a DLL.  
  
 [Breakpoints](../extensibility-debugger/breakpoints--visual-studio-sdk-.md)  
 Defines the three types of breakpoints—pending, bound, and error—in terms of debugging architecture.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Debugger Contexts](../extensibility-debugger/debugger-contexts.md)  
 Explains how the debug engine (DE) operates simultaneously within code, documentation, and expression evaluation contexts. Describes, for each of the three contexts, the location, position, or evaluation relevant to it.  
  
 [Debugger Components](../extensibility-debugger/debugger-components.md)  
 Provides an overview of the Visual Studio Debugging components, which include the debug engine (DE), expression evaluator (EE), and symbol handler (SH).  
  
 [Debugging Tasks](../extensibility-debugger/debugging-tasks.md)  
 Contains links to various debugging tasks, such as launching a program and evaluating expressions.
