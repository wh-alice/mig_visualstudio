# Port Suppliers
In terms of the debugger architecture, a **port supplier**:  
  
-   Is contained by a server and provides ports on request to that server.  
  
-   Can add and remove ports from the containing server.  
  
-   Can enumerate all the ports it has supplied to the server.  
  
-   Is represented by an [IDebugPortSupplier2](../extensibility-debugger-reference/idebugportsupplier2.md) interface, which is registered with Visual Studio through the registry. This interface can be obtained by calling [GetPortSupplier](../extensibility-debugger-reference/idebugcoreserver2--getportsupplier.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] provides a default port supplier and a default port. If a custom port needs to be implemented, a custom port supplier also needs to be implemented to supply those custom ports.
