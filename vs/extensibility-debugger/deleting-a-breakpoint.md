# Deleting a Breakpoint
The following describes the process when deleting a pending breakpoint:  
  
## Deletion Process  
 The session debug manager (SDM) calls the [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Delete](../extensibility-debugger-reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2--delete.md) method to remove the pending breakpoint and all bound breakpoints bound from it.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  A single bound breakpoint can also be deleted by a call to [IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::Delete](../extensibility-debugger-reference/idebugboundbreakpoint2--delete.md).
