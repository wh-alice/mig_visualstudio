# Developing Workflow Applications Targeting the .NET 3.0 or .NET 3.5 Framework
[!INCLUDE[vs2010](../code-quality/includes/vs2010_md.md)] provides the [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd1_md.md)] for creating [!INCLUDE[wf](../workflow-designer/includes/wf_md.md)] applications that target the [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../workflow-designer/includes/netfx40_long_md.md)]. The designer uses the familiar [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] user interface for the graphical construction and debugging of workflow applications.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../code-quality/includes/vs2010_md.md)] also provides access to a legacy workflow designer that can be used to target the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../workflow-designer/includes/netfx35_long_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../workflow-designer/includes/vstecwinfx_md.md)]. This section contains guidance on using this legacy designer.
