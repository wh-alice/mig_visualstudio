# How to: Create a Workflow Console Application
[!INCLUDE[wf](../workflow-designer/includes/wf_md.md)] allows you to create workflows for executing system or human processes. The [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd1_md.md)] provides the design surface for creating these workflows. The [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd2_md.md)] can be used to create workflows from within [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] or it can be integrated into other applications that rehost the designer.  
  
 This topic describes how to use the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd2_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../code-quality/includes/vs2010_md.md)] to create a workflow in a console application.  
  
### To create a workflow console application  
  
1.  Start [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../code-quality/includes/vs2010_md.md)].  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then select **Project…**.  
  
     The **New Project** dialog box opens.  
  
3.  In the **Installed Templates** pane, select **Workflow** from either the **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic** groupings, depending on your language of preference.  
  
4.  In the middle pane, select **Workflow Console Application**.  
  
5.  In the **Name** box, enter a descriptive name for your project to make it easy to identify.  
  
6.  In the **Location** box, enter the directory in which you want to save your project, or click **Browse** to navigate to it.  
  
7.  In the **Solution** box, enter the name for the new solution. Click **OK** to create the application.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you want to add a workflow console application to an existing solution, open that solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../code-quality/includes/vs2010_md.md)], right click the solution in **Solution Explorer**, and select **Add**, then **New Project…** to open the **New Project** dialog box. Proceed as described above in this procedure.  
  
8.  The project template creates a workflow definition in XAML and the console application definition is in source code. The [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd2_md.md)] opens and displays the canvas for the workflow you created.  
  
9. To compose a workflow, drag activities or other workflow items from the **Toolbox** to the design surface in your workflow.
