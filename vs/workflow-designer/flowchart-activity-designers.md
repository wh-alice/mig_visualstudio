# Flowchart Activity Designers
[!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd1_md.md)] includes a number of system-provided activities that you can use when constructing your workflows. This section contains the system-provided activities used to manage flowcharts within a workflow. The following topics describe these activities and provide guidance on how to use them.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Flowchart](../workflow-designer/flowchart-activity-designer.md)  
 **Used to create workflows that define and manage complex flow controls.**  [FlowDecision](../workflow-designer/flowdecision-activity-designer.md)  
 Provides a branch for the flow of control into one of two alternatives based on whether a specified condition is satisfied.  
  
 [FlowSwitch\<T>](../workflow-designer/flowswitch-t--activity-designer.md)  
 Provides branching for the flow of control based on match criterion when more than two alternative branches are required.
