# Theme Configuration Dialog Box (Legacy)
This topic describes how use the **Theme Configuration** dialog box in the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd1_md.md)]. Use the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd2_md.md)] when you need to target either the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../workflow-designer/includes/netfx35_long_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../workflow-designer/includes/vstecwinfx_md.md)].  
  
 A theme defines the background and foreground colors, styles, icons, and other visual elements of a workflow. You can save themes for reuse by other workflows.  
  
 You create and edit themes by using the **Theme Configuration** dialog box. To open the dialog box, select **Create New Theme** on the **Workflow** menu, or right-click the workflow design surface and select **Create New Theme**.
