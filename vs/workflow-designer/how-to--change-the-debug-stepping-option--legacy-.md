# How to: Change the Debug Stepping Option (Legacy)
This topic describes how to change the debug stepping option for [!INCLUDE[wf](../workflow-designer/includes/wf_md.md)] applications in the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd1_md.md)] that have concurrent actions. Use the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd2_md.md)] when you need to target either the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../workflow-designer/includes/netfx35_long_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../workflow-designer/includes/vstecwinfx_md.md)].  
  
 When you are debugging legacy activities that have concurrent execution, such as **ParallelActivity** or **ConditionedActivityGroup**, you can use one of two options to step through your code.  
  
 Follow these steps to change the debug stepping option in your legacy workflow project.  
  
## Procedures  
  
#### To change the debug stepping option  
  
1.  Start Visual Studio.  
  
2.  Open an existing legacy workflow project or create a new project that employs concurrent activities and that targets either the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../workflow-designer/includes/netfx35_long_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../workflow-designer/includes/vstecwinfx_md.md)].  
  
3.  On the **Workflow** menu in the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd2_md.md)], point to **Debug**, and then point to **Stepping Options**.  
  
4.  Select either **Instance** or **Branch**.
