The **Initialize Correlation** dialog box is used in [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd1_md.md)] to edit the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.InitializeCorrelation.CorrelationData*> property of an <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.InitializeCorrelation> activity. [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../code-quality/includes/crdefault_md.md)] the [InitializeCorrelation](../workflow-designer/initializecorrelation-activity-designer.md) topic.  
  
 The following table describes the user interface (UI) elements of the **Initialize Correlation** dialog box.

|**Correlation**|The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> of the correlation to initialize.|  
|**Initialize On**|A key/value pair that contains the data to initialize. This corresponds to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.InitializeCorrelation.CorrelationData*> property. An example of a valid key/value pair would be a key named “OrderID” paired with a variable named OrderID.|
