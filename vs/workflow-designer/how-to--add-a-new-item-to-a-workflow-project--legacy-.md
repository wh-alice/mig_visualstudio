# How to: Add a New Item to a Workflow Project (Legacy)
After you have created a workflow project using the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd1_md.md)] provided by [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../code-quality/includes/vs2010_md.md)] that targets either the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../workflow-designer/includes/netfx35_long_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../workflow-designer/includes/vstecwinfx_md.md)], you can add [!INCLUDE[wf](../workflow-designer/includes/wf_md.md)] items and other familiar [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] items to your project.  
  
 The following table lists the [!INCLUDE[wf2](../workflow-designer/includes/wf2_md.md)] items that you can add to a workflow project.  
  
|Item|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|Activity|An activity with the activity definition in a designer code file and user code in a separate code file.|  
|Activity (with code separation)|An activity definition expressed as workflow markup and user code in a separate code file.|  
|Sequential Workflow (code)|A sequential workflow with the workflow definition in a designer code file and user code in a separate code file.|  
|Sequential Workflow (with code separation)|A sequential workflow with the workflow definition expressed as workflow markup and user code in a separate code file.|  
|State Machine Workflow (code)|A state machine workflow with the workflow definition in a designer code file and user code in a separate code file.|  
|State Machine Workflow (with code separation)|A state machine workflow with the workflow definition expressed as workflow markup and user code in a separate code file.|  
  
### To add a new item to a workflow project  
  
1.  On the **Project** menu, click **Add a New Item**.  
  
     The **Add a New Item** dialog box opens.  
  
2.  Select an item.  
  
     The previous table lists the available Windows Workflow Foundation selections.  
  
3.  Click **Add** to add the item to the workflow project.
