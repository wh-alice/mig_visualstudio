# Control Flow Activity Designers
[!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd1_md.md)] includes a number of system-provided activities that you can use when constructing your workflows. This section contains the system-provided activities used to control the flow within a workflow. The following topics describe these activities and provide guidance on how to use them.  
  
## In This Section  
 [DoWhile](../workflow-designer/dowhile-activity-designer.md)  
 Executes the activity contained in its body at least once, until a specified condition evaluates to **true**.  
  
 [ForEach\<T>](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a680cddd-2760-497a-b27b-c023fcbc6f33)  
 Executes the activity contained in its body for each item in a specified collection.  
  
 [If](../workflow-designer/if-activity-designer.md)  
 Evaluates a condition and executes an activity depending on the results of that evaluation.  
  
 [Parallel](../workflow-designer/parallel-activity-designer.md)  
 Executes a collection of child activities concurrently.  
  
 [ParallelForEach\<T>](../workflow-designer/parallelforeach-t--activity-designer.md)  
 Enumerates the elements of a collection and executes an embedded statement for each element of the collection in parallel  
  
 [Pick](../workflow-designer/pick-activity-designer.md)  
 Executes one of several branches in response to some event that provides event-based flow control.  
  
 [PickBranch](../workflow-designer/pickbranch-activity-designer.md)  
 Provides a potential path of execution within a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick> activity.  
  
 [Sequence](../workflow-designer/sequence-activity-designer.md)  
 Contains an ordered collection of child activities that it executes in order.  
  
 [Switch\<T>](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ce1aa634-c4db-4475-a1c8-a88478a57212)  
 Evaluates a specified expression and executes the activity from a collection of activities whose associated key matches the value obtained from the evaluation.  
  
 [While](../workflow-designer/while-activity-designer.md)  
 Executes the activity contained in its body while a specified condition evaluates to **true**.
