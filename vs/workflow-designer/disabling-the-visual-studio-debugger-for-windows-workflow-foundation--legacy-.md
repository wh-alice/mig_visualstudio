# Disabling the Visual Studio Debugger for Windows Workflow Foundation (Legacy)
This topic describes how to disable the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Debugger using the configuration file when building [!INCLUDE[wf](../workflow-designer/includes/wf_md.md)] applications in the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd1_md.md)]. Use the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd2_md.md)] when you need to target either the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../workflow-designer/includes/netfx35_long_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../workflow-designer/includes/vstecwinfx_md.md)].  
  
 By default, the [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../misc/includes/vs_current_long_md.md)] Debugger for [!INCLUDE[wf](../workflow-designer/includes/wf_md.md)] is enabled for a host process. To disable workflow debugging, you must explicitly turn it off by adding a "DisableWorkflowDebugging" entry **\<switches>** element in the **\<system.diagnostics>** section of the host configuration file.  
  
 The following example shows how to modify the host configuration file to disable workflow debugging.  
  
```  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>  
<configuration>  
   <system.diagnostics>  
      <switches>  
         <add name="DisableWorkflowDebugging" value="true"/>  
      </switches>  
   </system.diagnostics>  
</configuration>  
```
