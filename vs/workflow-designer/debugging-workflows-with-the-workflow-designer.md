# Debugging Workflows with the Workflow Designer
The [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd1_md.md)] provides the ability to debug workflows and custom activities. The process and behavior are similar to that of the default [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../misc/includes/vs2010_md.md)] debugger. The topics in this section describe how to perform traditional debugging procedures as well as debugging XAML and expressions.
