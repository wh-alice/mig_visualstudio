# CorrelationScope Activity Designer
The **CorrelationScope** activity designer is used to create and configure a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> activity that provides implicit management of child messaging activities using a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> object.  
  
## The CorrelationScope Activity  
 The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope.CorrelatesWith*> property specifies the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> used to manage child messaging activities. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activities contained in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope.Body*> are configured to use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope.CorrelatesWith*> property of the containing <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> activity to perform correlation.  
  
### Using the CorrelationScope Activity Designer  
 The **CorrelationScope** activity designer can be found in the **Messaging** category of the **Toolbox**, which is accessed by clicking the **Toolbox** tab on the left side of the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd2_md.md)] (Alternatively, select **Toolbar** from the **View** menu, or CTRL+ALT+X.)  
  
 The **CorrelationScope** activity designer can be dragged from the **Toolbox** and dropped on to the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd2_md.md)] surface. This creates a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> activity with a default **DisplayName** of CorrelationScope. The <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName*> can be edited in the header of the **CorrelationScope** activity designer or in the **DisplayName** box of the **Properties** window.  
  
 To specify the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> used by child messaging activities, click the ellipse button beside the **CorrelatesWith** field in **Properties** window to display the **Expression Editor** dialog box. This property can also be set on the activity designer surface.  
  
 The activities scoped within the correlation are specified by dropping their designers within the **Body** box within the **CorrelationScope** designer.  
  
### The CorrelationScope Properties  
 The following table shows the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> properties and describes how they are used in the designer. These properties can be edited either in **Properties** window or on [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd2_md.md)] designer surface, and often in both.  
  
|Property Name|Required|Usage|  
|-------------------|--------------|-----------|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName*>|False|The optional friendly name of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.InitializeCorrelation> activity.|  
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope.CorrelatesWith*>|False|Specifies the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> used to manage child messaging activities. If you do not set this property, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> creates an implicit <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> automatically.|  
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope.Body*>|False|Specifies the activities within the scope of the correlation.|
