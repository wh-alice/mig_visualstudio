# How to: Create a PolicyActivity Rule Set (Legacy)
This topic describes how to create a policy activity rule set using the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd1_md.md)] that targets the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../workflow-designer/includes/netfx35_long_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../workflow-designer/includes/vstecwinfx_md.md)].  
  
 After you have dragged a **Policy** activity item from the **Toolbox** to the workflow design surface, you will want to select an existing rule or create a new rule set for the [PolicyActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65019) activity. You select an existing rule set by using the [Select Rule Set Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/select-rule-set-dialog-box--legacy-.md) and you create rule sets by using the [Rule Set Editor Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/rule-set-editor-dialog-box--legacy-.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can open the [Rule Set Editor Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/rule-set-editor-dialog-box--legacy-.md) dialog box directly by double-clicking on a [PolicyActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65019) activity that is on the workflow design surface.  
  
### To select or create a rule set for a PolicyActivity activity  
  
1.  Right-click the [PolicyActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65019), and then click **Properties** to open the **Properties** window.  
  
2.  Click the **RuleSetReference** property.  
  
3.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   Click the **RuleSetReference** ellipses **[…]**, and then select an existing rule set in the [Select Rule Set Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/select-rule-set-dialog-box--legacy-.md). Then go to step 10.  
  
         -or-  
  
    -   Type a name for a rule set. Click the **RuleSetReference** ellipses **[…]**, and then select **Edit** in the [Select Rule Set Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/select-rule-set-dialog-box--legacy-.md).  
  
         -or-  
  
    -   Type a name for a rule set. Expand the **RuleSetReference** property and select the ellipses **[…]** in the **RuleSet Definition** property.  
  
         The [Rule Set Editor Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/rule-set-editor-dialog-box--legacy-.md) opens.  
  
4.  In the [Rule Set Editor Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/rule-set-editor-dialog-box--legacy-.md), click **Add Rule** to add a new rule to the rule set.  
  
5.  Enter the **Name**, **Priority**, and **Reevaluation** properties, or keep the default values.  
  
6.  Enter the text for the **Condition**.  
  
7.  Enter the text for the **Then Actions** and the **Else Actions**.  
  
8.  Click **Add Rule** again to add another rule.  
  
9. When you are finished, click **OK**.
