# Bind to an Activity&#39;s Property Dialog Box (Legacy)
This topic describes how use the **Bind to an Activity's Property** dialog box in the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd1_md.md)]. Use the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd2_md.md)] when you need to target either the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../workflow-designer/includes/netfx35_long_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../workflow-designer/includes/vstecwinfx_md.md)].  
  
 An instance type of dependency property can be bound to another activity's public property or event. For more information about activity binding, see [Using Dependency Properties](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65007).

You open this dialog box by clicking the ellipses **[â€¦]** at the end of the selected property's text box in the **Properties** window, or by clicking the blue exclamation mark icon that appears next to the property name in the property browser.
