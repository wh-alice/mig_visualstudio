# How to: Automatically Increment the ClickOnce Publish Version
When publishing a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] application, changing the `Publish Version` property causes the application to be published as an update. By default, Visual Studio automatically increments the `Revision` number of the `Publish Version` each time you publish the application.  
  
 You can disable this behavior on the **Publish** page of the **Project Designer**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
### To disable automatically incrementing the Publish Version  
  
1.  With a project selected in **Solution Explorer**, on the **Project** menu, click **Properties**.  
  
2.  Click the **Publish** tab.  
  
3.  In the **Publish Version** section, clear the **Automatically increment revision with each release** check box.
