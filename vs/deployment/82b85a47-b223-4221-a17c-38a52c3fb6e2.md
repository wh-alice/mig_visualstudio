# Walkthrough: Downloading Satellite Assemblies on Demand with the ClickOnce Deployment API Using the Designer
Windows Forms applications can be configured for multiple cultures through the use of satellite assemblies. A *satellite assembly* is an assembly that contains application resources for a culture other than the application's default culture.  
  
 As discussed in [Localizing ClickOnce Applications](../deployment/localizing-clickonce-applications.md), you can include multiple satellite assemblies for multiple cultures within the same [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] deployment. By default, [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] will download all of the satellite assemblies in your deployment to the client machine, although a single client will probably require only one satellite assembly.  
  
 This walkthrough demonstrates how to mark your satellite assemblies as optional, and download only the assembly a client machine needs for its current culture settings.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For testing purposes, the following code examples programmatically set the culture to `ja-JP`. See the "Next Steps" section later in this topic for information on how to adjust this code for a production environment.  
  
### To mark satellite assemblies as optional  
  
1.  Build your project. This will generate satellite assemblies for all of the cultures you are localizing to.  
  
2.  Right-click on your project name in Solution Explorer, and click **Properties**.  
  
3.  Click the **Publish** tab, and then click **Application Files**.  
  
4.  Select the **Show all files** check box to display satellite assemblies. By default, all satellite assemblies will be included in your deployment and will be visible in this dialog box.  
  
     A satellite assembly will have a name in the form *isoCode*\ApplicationName.resources.dll, where *isoCode* is a language identifier in RFC 1766 format.  
  
5.  Click **New...** in the **Download Group** list for each language identifier. When prompted for a download group name, enter the language identifier. For example, for a Japanese satellite assembly, you would specify the download group name `ja-JP`.  
  
6.  Close the **Application Files** dialog box.  
  
### To download satellite assemblies on demand in C#  
  
1.  Open the Program.cs file. If you do not see this file in Solution Explorer, select your project, and on the **Project** menu, click **Show All Files**.  
  
2.  Use the following code to download the appropriate satellite assembly and start your application.  
  
     [!code[ClickOnce.SatelliteAssemblies#1](../deployment/codesnippet/CSharp/82b85a47-b223-4221-a17c-38a52c3fb6e2_1.cs)]  
  
### To download satellite assemblies on demand in Visual Basic  
  
1.  In the **Properties** window for the application, click the **Application** tab.  
  
2.  At the bottom of the tab page, click **View Application Events**.  
  
3.  Add the following imports to the beginning of the ApplicationEvents.VB file.  
  
     [!code[ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesVB#1](../deployment/codesnippet/VisualBasic/82b85a47-b223-4221-a17c-38a52c3fb6e2_2.vb)]  
  
4.  Add the following code to the `MyApplication` class.  
  
     [!code[ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesVB#2](../deployment/codesnippet/VisualBasic/82b85a47-b223-4221-a17c-38a52c3fb6e2_3.vb)]  
  
## Next Steps  
 In a production environment, you will likely need to remove the line in the code examples that sets \<xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture*> to a specific value, because client machines will have the correct value set by default. When your application runs on a Japanese client machine, for example, \<xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture*> will be `ja-JP` by default. Setting it programmatically is a good way to test your satellite assemblies before you deploy your application.
