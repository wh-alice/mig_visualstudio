# Connecting to Data in Visual Studio
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] provides tools to connect your application to data from many different sources, such as databases, services, and objects. Connections to data are created either programmatically (in code), as the result of dropping data objects onto a form or component designer, or through the completion of one of the data wizards. The following topics explain how to create connections to databases, services, and objects from your application.
