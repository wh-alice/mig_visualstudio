# The selected class cannot be deleted because it is used as a return type for one or more DataContext methods
The return type of one or more <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> methods is the selected entity class. Deleting an entity class that is used as the return type for a <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> method will cause the compilation of the project to fail. To delete the selected entity class, identify the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> methods that use it and set their return types to a different entity class.  
  
 To revert the return types of <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> methods to their original auto-generated types, first delete the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> method from the methods pane and then drag the object from **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer** onto the O/R Designer again.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Identify <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> methods that use the entity class as a return type by selecting a <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> method in the methods pane and inspecting the **Return Type** property in the **Properties** window.  
  
2.  Set the **Return Type** to a different entity class or delete the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> method from the methods pane.
