# One or more selected items contain a data type that is not supported by the designer
One or more of the items dragged from **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer** onto the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../datatools/includes/vs_ordesigner_short_md.md)] contains a data type that is not supported by the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../datatools/includes/vs_ordesigner_short_md.md)] (for example, [CLR User-Defined Types](../Topic/CLR%20User-Defined%20Types.md)).  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Create a view that is based on the desired table and that does not include the unsupported data type.  
  
2.  Drag the view from **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer** onto the designer.
