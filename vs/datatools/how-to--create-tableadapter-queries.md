# How to: Create TableAdapter Queries
TableAdapter queries are SQL statements or stored procedures that your application can execute against a database.  
  
 Add as many queries to a TableAdapter as your application requires. TableAdapter queries appear as methods on a TableAdapter. When you create a query called `FillByCity` that takes a parameter representing the city value, the query is added to the TableAdapter. It is added as a typed method that takes the correct type of parameter as an argument â€” in this case a string representing the city value. You call the TableAdapter query just like any method on any object. For example, the following code executes the `FillByCity` query and fills the `Customers` table with all customers with a city value of `Seattle`:

[!code[VbRaddataTableAdapters#1](../datatools/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to--create-tableadapter-queries_1.cs)]  
  
 TableAdapter queries can fill a data table (`Fill` and `FillBy` queries) or return new data tables populated with the data returned by the query (`GetData` and `GetDataBy` queries).  
  
 You can add queries to existing TableAdapters by running the [Editing TableAdapters](../datatools/editing-tableadapters.md). (Right-click any TableAdapter and choose **Add Query**.)

## Create a query in the Dataset Designer  
  
#### To add a query to a TableAdapter in the Dataset Designer  
  
1.  Open a dataset in the **Dataset Designer**. For more information, see [How to: Open a Dataset in the Dataset Designer](../Topic/How%20to:%20Open%20a%20Dataset%20in%20the%20Dataset%20Designer.md).  
  
2.  Right-click the desired TableAdapter, and select **Add Query**.  
  
     -or-  
  
3.  Drag a **Query** from the **DataSet** tab of the **Toolbox** onto a table on the designer.  
  
     The **TableAdapter Query Configuration Wizard** opens.  
  
4.  Complete the wizard; the query is added to the TableAdapter.  
  
## Create a Query Directly on a Form in Your Windows Application  
 If you have an instance of a TableAdapter on your form you can add a query using the [Search Criteria Builder Dialog Box](../Topic/Search%20Criteria%20Builder%20Dialog%20Box.md), which adds a \<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> control to the form that accepts any input parameters required by the query, as well as a button to run the query.  
  
#### To add a query to a TableAdapter using the Search Criteria dialog box  
  
1.  Select a TableAdapter in the component tray.  
  
2.  Click the TableAdapter's smart tag, and choose **Add Query**.  
  
3.  Complete the dialog box and the query is added to the TableAdapter. For more information, see [Search Criteria Builder Dialog Box](../Topic/Search%20Criteria%20Builder%20Dialog%20Box.md).
