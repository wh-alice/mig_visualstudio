# How to: Add Global Queries to a TableAdapter
*Global queries* are SQL queries that return either a single (scalar) value or no value. Typically, global functions perform database operations such as inserts, updates, deletes, and the aggregating of information, such as returning a count of customers in a table or the total charges for all items in a particular order.  
  
 You add global queries by running the **TableAdapter Query Configuration Wizard** from within the **Dataset Designer**.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../datatools/includes/note_settings_general_md.md)]  
  
### To add a global query to a dataset  
  
1.  Open a dataset in the **Dataset Designer**. For more information, see [How to: Open a Dataset in the Dataset Designer](../Topic/How%20to:%20Open%20a%20Dataset%20in%20the%20Dataset%20Designer.md).  
  
2.  Drag a **Query** from the **DataSet** tab of the **Toolbox** onto an empty area of the **Dataset Designer**.  
  
     The [Editing TableAdapters](../datatools/editing-tableadapters.md) opens.  
  
3.  Choose a connection for the query to use. You can either choose one from the list or create a new connection. If you create a new connection, you will have the option to save it to the application configuration file. For more information, see [How to: Save and Edit Connection Strings](../Topic/How%20to:%20Save%20and%20Edit%20Connection%20Strings.md).  
  
4.  Choose whether to use SQL statements or stored procedures.  
  
5.  Choose the stored procedure to use or, on the **Choose a Query Type** page of the wizard, choose the type of query you want and then click **Next**.  
  
6.  Provide a query that performs the desired task, for example, `SELECT COUNT(*) AS CustomerCount FROM Customers`.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Dragging a query directly onto the **Dataset Designer** creates a method that will only return a scalar (single) value. While the query or stored procedure you select may return more than a single value, the method created by the wizard will only return a single value. For example, the query might return the first column of the first row of the returned data.  
  
7.  Complete the wizard; the query is added to the **Dataset Designer**. For information on running the query, see [How to: Execute TableAdapter Queries](../Topic/How%20to:%20Execute%20TableAdapter%20Queries.md).
