# Bind Windows Forms controls to data in Visual Studio
You can display data to users of your application by binding data to Windows Forms. To create these data-bound controls, you can drag items from the **Data Sources** window onto the Windows Forms Designer in Visual Studio. This topic describes some of the most common tasks, tools, and classes involved in creating data-bound Windows Forms applications.

 For general information about how to create data-bound controls in Visual Studio, see [Bind controls to data in Visual Studio](../datatools/bind-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio.md). For more information about data binding in Windows Forms, see [Windows Forms Data Binding](../Topic/Windows%20Forms%20Data%20Binding.md).

## BindingSource component  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component serves two purposes. First, it provides a layer of abstraction when binding the controls on your form to data. Controls on the form are bound to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component (instead of being bound directly to a data source).  
  
 Second, it can manage a collection of objects. Adding a type to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> creates a list of that type.  
  
 For more information about the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component, see:  
  
-   [BindingSource Component](../Topic/BindingSource%20Component.md)  
  
-   [BindingSource Component Overview](../Topic/BindingSource%20Component%20Overview.md)  
  
-   [BindingSource Component Architecture](../Topic/BindingSource%20Component%20Architecture.md)  
  
## BindingNavigator control  
 This component provides a user interface for navigating through data displayed by a Windows application. For more information, see [BindingNavigator Control](../Topic/BindingNavigator%20Control%20\(Windows%20Forms\).md).  
  
## DataGridView control  
 To display and edit tabular data from many different kinds of data sources, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. You can bind data to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataSource*> property. For more information, see [DataGridView Control Overview](../Topic/DataGridView%20Control%20Overview%20\(Windows%20Forms\).md).
