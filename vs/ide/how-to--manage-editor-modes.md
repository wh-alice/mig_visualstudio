# How to: Manage Editor Modes
You can display the Visual Studio Code Editor in various display modes.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](assetId:///22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
## Enabling Full Screen mode  
 You can choose to hide all tool windows and view only document windows by enabling **Full Screen** mode.  
  
#### To enable Full Screen mode  
  
-   Press ALT+SHIFT+ENTER to enter or exit **Full Screen** mode.  
  
     -- or --  
  
-   Issue the command `View.Fullscreen` in the **Command** window.  
  
## Enabling Virtual Space mode  
 In **Virtual Space** mode, spaces are inserted at the end of each line of code. Select this option to position comments at a consistent point next to your code.  
  
#### To enable Virtual Space mode  
  
1.  Select **Options** from the **Tools** menu.  
  
2.  Expand the **Text Editor** folder, and choose **All Languages** to set this option globally, or choose a specific language folder. (For example, to turn on line numbers only in Visual Basic, choose the Basic, Text Editor options.)  
  
3.  Select **General** options, and under **Settings**, select **Enable Virtual Space**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  **Virtual Space** is enabled in **Column Selection** mode. When **Virtual Space** mode is not enabled, the insertion point moves from the end of one line directly to the first character of the next.
