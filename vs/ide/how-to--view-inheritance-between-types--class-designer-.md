# How to: View Inheritance Between Types (Class Designer)
You can find the inheritance relationship, if it exists, between a base type and its derived types on a class diagram in Class Designer. To create an inheritance relationship, if none exist, between two types, see [How to: Create Inheritance Between Types (Class Designer)](../ide/how-to--create-inheritance-between-types--class-designer-.md).  
  
### To find the base type  
  
1.  On the class diagram, click the type for which you want to see the base class or interface.  
  
2.  On the **Class Diagram** menu, choose **Show Base Class** or **Show Base Interfaces**.  
  
     The type's base class or interface appears selected on the diagram. Any hidden inheritance lines now appear between the two shapes.  
  
 You can also right-click the type whose base type you want to display, and choose **Show Base Class** or **Show Base Interfaces**.  
  
### To find the derived types  
  
1.  On the class diagram, click the type for which you want to see the derived classes or interfaces.  
  
2.  On the **Class Diagram** menu, choose **Show Derived Classes** or **Show Derived Interfaces**.  
  
     The typeâ€™s derived classes or interfaces appear on the diagram. Any hidden inheritance lines now appear between the shapes.  
  
 You can also right-click the type for which you want to see its derived types, and choose **Show Derived Classes** or **Show Derived Interfaces**.
