# Visual Basic-Specific IntelliSense
The Visual Basic source code editor offers the following IntelliSense features:  
  
-   Syntax tips  
  
     Syntax tips display the syntax of the statement that you are typing. This is useful for statements such as [Declare](../Topic/Declare%20Statement.md).  
  
## Automatic Completion  
  
-   Completion on various keywords  
  
     For example, if you type `goto` and a space, IntelliSense will display a list of the defined labels in a drop-down menu. Other supported keywords include `Exit`, `Implements`, `Option`, and `Declare`.  
  
-   Completion on `Enum` and `Boolean`  
  
     When a statement will refer to a member of an enumeration, IntelliSense will display a list of the members of the `Enum`. When a statement will refer to a `Boolean`, IntelliSense will display a true-false drop-down menu.  
  
 Completion can be turned off by default by deselecting **Auto list members** from the **General** property page in the **Visual Basic** folder.  
  
 You can manually invoke completion by invoking List Members, Complete Word, or ALT+RIGHT ARROW. For more information, see [Using IntelliSense](../ide/using-intellisense.md).  
  
## IntelliSense in Zone  
 IntelliSense in Zone assists Visual Basic developers who need to deploy applications through [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] and are constrained to partial trust settings. This feature:  
  
-   Enables you to choose the permissions the application will run with.  
  
-   Display APIs in the chosen Zone as available in List Members, and display APIs that require additional permissions as unavailable.  
  
 For more information, see [Code Access Security for ClickOnce Applications](../deployment/code-access-security-for-clickonce-applications.md).
