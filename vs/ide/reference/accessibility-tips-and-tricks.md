# Accessibility Tips and Tricks
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] includes built-in accessibility features so you can easily work from the keyboard and use screen readers or other assistive technology devices. The topic includes some suggestions for optimizing [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] for accessibility as well as some useful shortcut key combinations.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
## Save Your IDE Settings  
 You can customize your IDE experience by saving your window layout, keyboard mapping scheme, and other preferences. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
## Common Windows Shortcut Key Combinations  
 You can use many of the standard Windows shortcut key combinations to perform tasks within [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. Some of these shortcut key combinations include:
