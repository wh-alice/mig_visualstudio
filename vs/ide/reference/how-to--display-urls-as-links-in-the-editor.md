# How to: Display URLs as Links in the Editor
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../code-quality/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can choose to have the Code Editor treat Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) in your code as active links. When you use this feature, URLs:  
  
-   Appear underlined.  
  
-   Display a **ToolTip** when you hover over them.  
  
-   Attempt to open the Web site indicated when you **CTRL** + left-click on the link. By default, the Web site is displayed in the internal Web browser.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
## Procedure  
  
#### To display URLs as links  
  
1.  On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.  
  
2.  Click **Text Editor**.  
  
3.  To change the option for only one language, expand the folder for that language and choose **General**.  
  
     —or—  
  
     To change the option for all languages, expand the **All Languages** folder and choose **General**.  
  
4.  Under **Display**, select **Enable single-click URL navigation**.
