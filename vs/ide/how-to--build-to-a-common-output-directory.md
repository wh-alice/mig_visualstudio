# How to: Build to a Common Output Directory
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../code-quality/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

By default, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] builds each project in a solution in its own folder inside the solution. You can change the build output paths of your projects to force all outputs to be placed in the same folder.  
  
### To place all solution outputs in a common directory  
  
1.  Click on one project in the solution.  
  
2.  On the **Project** menu, click **Properties**.  
  
3.  Depending on the type of project, click on either the **Compile** tab or the **Build** tab, and set the **Output path** to a folder to use for all projects in the solution.  
  
4.  Repeat steps 1-3 for all projects in the solution.
