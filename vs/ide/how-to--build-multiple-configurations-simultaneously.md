# How to: Build Multiple Configurations Simultaneously
You can build most types of projects with multiple, or even all, of their build configurations at the same time by using the **Batch Build** dialog box. However, you can't build the following types of projects in multiple build configurations at the same time:  
  
1.  [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../codequality/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] apps built for Windows using JavaScript.  
  
2.  All Visual Basic projects.  
  
 For more information about build configurations, see [Understanding Build Configurations](../ide/understanding-build-configurations.md).  
  
### To build a project in multiple build configurations  
  
1.  On the menu bar, choose **Build**, **Batch Build**.  
  
2.  In the **Build** column, select the check boxes for the configurations in which you want to build a project.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  To edit or create a build configuration for a solution, choose **Build**, **Configuration Manager** on the menu bar to open the **Configuration Manager** dialog box. After you have edited a build configuration for a solution, choose the **Rebuild** button in the **Batch Build** dialog box to update all build configurations for the projects in the solution.  
  
3.  Choose the **Build** or **Rebuild** buttons to build the project with the configurations that you specified.
