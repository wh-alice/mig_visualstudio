# Visual C# Code Snippets
Code snippets are ready-made snippets of code you can quickly insert into your code. For example, the `for` code snippet creates an empty `for` loop. Some code snippets are surround-with code snippets, which enable you to select lines of code, and then choose a code snippet which incorporates the selected lines of code. For example, when you select lines of code and then activate the `for` code snippet, it creates a `for` loop with those lines of code inside the loop block. Code snippets can make writing program code quicker, easier, and more reliable.  
  
 You can insert a code snippet at the cursor location, or insert a surround-with code snippet around the currently selected code. The Code Snippet Inserter is invoked through the **Insert Code Snippet** or **Surround With** commands on the **IntelliSense** menu, or by using the keyboard shortcuts CTRL+K and then X or CTRL+K and then S respectively.  
  
 The Code Snippet Inserter displays the code snippet name for all available code snippets. The Code Snippet Inserter also includes an input dialog box where you can type the name of the code snippet, or part of the code snippet name. The Code Snippet Inserter highlights the closest match to a code snippet name. Pressing TAB at any time will dismiss the Code Snippet Inserter and insert the currently selected code snippet. Typing ESC or clicking the mouse in the Code Editor will dismiss the Code Snippet Inserter without inserting a code snippet.
