# How to: Copy Class Diagram Elements to a Microsoft Office Document (Class Designer)
You can copy shapes from a .NET class diagram (.cd file) to other documents. You'll either get a copy of the shape or its underlying code based on the kind of document where you paste it. To copy shapes from UML class diagrams in a modeling project, see [Export diagrams as images](../modeling/export-diagrams-as-images.md).  
  
### To copy a single element  
  
-   Right-click the shape and choose **Copy Image**.  
  
### To copy several elements  
  
1.  Select the shapes on the diagram that you want to copy.  
  
2.  Right-click your selection and choose **Copy Image**.  
  
### To copy all the elements in a class diagram  
  
1.  Right-click the diagram surface and choose **Select All**. (Keyboard: **Ctrl + A**)  
  
2.  On the **Edit** menu, select **Copy Image**.  
  
 You can also choose **Copy** instead of **Copy Image**. **Copy** copies the image as a regular bitmap. **Copy Image** copies the image as a vector-based image, which is better for most Office applications.
