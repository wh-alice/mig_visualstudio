# Security and Localized Satellite Assemblies
If your main assembly uses strong naming, satellite assemblies must be signed with the same private key as the main assembly. If the public/private key pair does not match between the main and satellite assemblies, your resources will not be loaded. For more information on signing assemblies, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../Topic/How%20to:%20Sign%20an%20Assembly%20with%20a%20Strong%20Name.md).  
  
 In general, you may need to have your organization's signing group or an external signing organization sign with the private key. This is due to the sensitive nature of the private key: access is often restricted to a few individuals. You can use delayed signing during development. For more information, see [Delay Signing an Assembly](../Topic/Delay%20Signing%20an%20Assembly.md).
