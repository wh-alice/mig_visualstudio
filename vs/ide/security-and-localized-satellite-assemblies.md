# Security and Localized Satellite Assemblies
If your main assembly uses strong naming, satellite assemblies must be signed with the same private key as the main assembly. If the public/private key pair does not match between the main and satellite assemblies, your resources will not be loaded. For more information on signing assemblies, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/2c30799a-a826-46b4-a25d-c584027a6c67).  
  
 In general, you may need to have your organization's signing group or an external signing organization sign with the private key. This is due to the sensitive nature of the private key: access is often restricted to a few individuals. You can use delayed signing during development. For more information, see [Delay Signing an Assembly](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/9d300e17-5bf1-4360-97da-2aa55efd9070).
