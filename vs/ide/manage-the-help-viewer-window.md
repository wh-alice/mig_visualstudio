# Manage the Help Viewer Window
In the Help Viewer you can customize the window layout.  
  
## Docking Tabs  
 The Help Viewer supports standard docking functionality. By default, all tabs in the Help Viewer are docked, but you can move them, resize them, dock them in other locations, and "float" them so that they appear as independent child windows.  
  
 To restore the Help Viewer window to its default layout, open the **Viewer Options** dialog box, and then choose the **Reset** button.  
  
## Opening a Topic in a New Tab  
 Choose the topic in any navigation tab, and then choose the Ctrl + Enter keys.  
  
## Minimize a Navigation Tab  
 Create more space for viewing topics by choosing the pin icon for the navigation tabs. When these tabs are minimized, only their labels appear on the closest edge of the window. To restore the tabs, choose the label of any tab, and then choose the pin icon again.
