# Filtered Completion Lists in Visual Basic
In Visual Basic, IntelliSense completion lists have two tab controls located near the bottom of the lists. The **Common** tab, which is selected by default, displays items that are most often used to complete the statement that you are writing. The **All** tab displays all items that are available for automatic completion, including those that are also on the **Common** tab.
