# Step 6: Name Your Button Controls
There's only one PictureBox on your form. When you added it, the IDE automatically named it **pictureBox1**. There's only one CheckBox, which is named **checkBox1**. Soon, you will write some code, and that code will refer to the CheckBox and PictureBox. Because there's only one of each of these controls, you will know what it means when you see **pictureBox1** or **checkBox1** in your code.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In Visual Basic, the default first letter of any control name is initial cap, so the names are **PictureBox1**, **CheckBox1**, and so on.  
  
 There are four buttons on your form, and the IDE named them **button1**, **button2**, **button3**, and **button4**. By just looking at their current names, you don't know which button is the **Close** button and which one is the **Show a picture** button. That's why giving your button controls more informative names is helpful.  
  
 ![link to video](../code-quality/media/playvideo.gif "PlayVideo")For a video version of this topic, see [Tutorial 1: Create a Picture Viewer in Visual Basic - Video 3](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=205213) or [Tutorial 1: Create a Picture Viewer in C# - Video 3](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=205202). These videos use an earlier version of Visual Studio, so there are slight differences in some menu commands and other user interface elements. However, the concepts and procedures work similarly in the current version of Visual Studio.  
  
### To name your button controls  
  
1.  On the form, choose the **Close** button. (If you still have all the buttons selected, choose the ESC key to cancel the selection.) Scroll in the **Properties** window until you see the **(Name)** property. (The **(Name)** property is near the top when the properties are alphabetical.) Change the name to **closeButton**, as shown in the following picture.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you try changing the name of your button to **closeButton**, with a space between the words close and Button, the IDE displays an error message: "Property value is not valid." Spaces (and a few other characters) are not allowed in control names.  
  
2.  Rename the other three buttons to **backgroundButton**, **clearButton**, and **showButton**. You can verify the names by choosing the control selector drop-down list in the **Properties** window. The new button names appear.  
  
3.  Double-click the **Show a picture** button on the form. As an alternative, choose the **Show a picture** button on the form, and then choose the ENTER key. When you do, the IDE opens an additional tab in the main window called **Form1.cs** (**Form1.vb** if you're using Visual Basic). This tab shows the code file behind the form, as shown in the following picture.  
  
     ![Form1.cs tab with Visual C&#35; code](../ide/media/express_showbuttoncode.png "Express_ShowButtonCode")

4.  Focus on this part of the code. (Choose the **VB** tab below if you're using Visual Basic to view the Visual Basic version of the code.)  
  
     [!code[VbExpressTutorial1Step6#1](../ide/codesnippet/VisualBasic/step-6--name-your-button-controls_1.vb)]
[!code[VbExpressTutorial1Step6#1](../ide/codesnippet/CSharp/step-6--name-your-button-controls_1.cs)]  
  
     You are looking at code called `showButton_Click()`. The IDE added this to the form's code when you opened the code file for the **showButton** button. At design-time, when you open the code file for a control in a form, code is generated for the control if it doesn't already exist. This code, known as a *method*, runs when you run your program and choose the control - in this case, the **Show a picture** button.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  In this tutorial, the Visual Basic code that's automatically generated has been simplified by removing everything between the parentheses, (). Whenever this occurs, you can remove the same code. Your program will work either way. For the remainder of the tutorials, any automatically generated code is simplified whenever possible.  
  
5.  Choose the Windows Forms Designer tab again (**Form1.cs [Design]** in Visual C#, **Form1.vb [Design]** in Visual Basic) and then open the code file for the **Clear the picture** button to create a method for it in the form's code. Repeat this for the remaining two buttons. Each time, the IDE adds a new method to the form's code file.  
  
6.  To add one more method, open the code file for the CheckBox control in Windows Forms Designer to make the IDE add a `checkBox1_CheckedChanged()` method. That method is called whenever the user selects or clears the check box.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  When working on a program, you often move between the code editor and Windows Forms Designer. The IDE makes it easy to navigate in your project. Use **Solution Explorer** to open Windows Forms Designer by double-clicking **Form1.cs** in Visual C# or **Form1.vb** in Visual Basic, or on the menu bar, choose **View**, **Designer**.  
  
     The following shows the new code that you see in the code editor.  
  
     [!code[VbExpressTutorial1Step6#2](../ide/codesnippet/VisualBasic/step-6--name-your-button-controls_2.vb)]
[!code[VbExpressTutorial1Step6#2](../ide/codesnippet/CSharp/step-6--name-your-button-controls_2.cs)]  
  
     The five methods that you added are called *event handlers*, because your program calls them whenever an event (like a user choosing a button or selecting a box) happens.  
  
     When you view the code for a control in the IDE at design time, Visual Studio adds an event handler method for the control if one isn't there. For example, when you double-click a button, the IDE adds an event handler for its Click event (which is called whenever the user chooses the button). When you double-click a check box, the IDE adds an event handler for its CheckedChanged event (which is called whenever the user selects or clears the box).  
  
     After you add an event handler for a control, you can return to it at any time from Windows Forms Designer by double-clicking the control, or on the menu bar, choosing **View**, **Code**.  
  
     Names are important when you build programs, and methods (including event handlers) can have any name that you want. When you add an event handler with the IDE, it creates a name based on the control's name and the event being handled. For example, the Click event for a button named **showButton** is called the `showButton_Click()` event handler method. Also, opening and closing parentheses () are usually added after the method name to indicate that methods are being discussed. If you decide you want to change a code variable name, right-click the variable in the code and then choose **Refactor**, **Rename**. All instances of that variable in the code are renamed. See [Rename Refactoring (C#)](../csharp/rename-refactoring--csharp-.md) or [Refactoring and Rename Dialog Box](../Topic/Refactoring%20and%20Rename%20Dialog%20Box%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md) for more information.
