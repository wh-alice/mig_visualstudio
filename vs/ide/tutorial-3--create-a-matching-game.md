# Tutorial 3: Create a Matching Game
In this tutorial, you build a matching game, where the player must match pairs of hidden icons. You learn how to:  
  
-   Store objects, such as icons, in a `List` object.  
  
-   Use a `foreach` loop in Visual C# or a `For Each` loop in Visual Basic to iterate through items in a list.  
  
-   Keep track of a form's state by using reference variables.  
  
-   Build an event handler to respond to events that you can use with multiple objects.  
  
-   Make a timer that counts down and then fires an event exactly once after being started.  
  
 When you finish this tutorial, your program will look like the following picture.
