# Customize your model with profiles and stereotypes
In Visual Studio, you can adapt the standard UML model elements, such as classes and components, to customize them for specific purposes. You can apply a *stereotype* to a model element that can change the element's list of properties. Stereotypes are defined within collections called *profiles*.  
  
 To see which versions of Visual Studio support this feature, see [Version support for architecture and modeling tools](../modeling/what-s-new-for-design-in-visual-studio.md#VersionSupport).  
  
 To use a stereotype, you link a package to a profile. This lets you apply the stereotypes that are defined in the profile to the elements in the package. Some profiles are installed together with Visual Studio. In addition, you can define your own profiles.  
  
 Stereotypes can be set in the Properties list of an element. For the major kinds of shape on a diagram, the applied stereotypes also appear in the shape, as shown in the example.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you use a profile to create a model, and then share the model with someone else, they will be unable to see the stereotypes unless they have installed the same profile on their computer.
