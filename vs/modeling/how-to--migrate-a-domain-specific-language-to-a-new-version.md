# How to: Migrate a Domain-Specific Language to a New Version
You can migrate projects that define and use domain-specific language to [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../modeling/includes/vs2010_md.md)] from the version of [!INCLUDE[dsl](../modeling/includes/dsl_md.md)] that was distributed with [!INCLUDE[vs_orcas_long](../debugger/includes/vs_orcas_long_md.md)].  
  
 A migration tool is provided as part of [!INCLUDE[vssdk_current_long](../misc/includes/vssdk_current_long_md.md)]. The tool converts [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] projects and solutions that use or define DSL Tools.  
  
 You must run the migration tool explicitly: it is not launched automatically when you open a solution in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. The tool and detailed guidance document can be found at this path:  
  
 **%Program Files%\Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SDK\VisualStudioIntegration\Tools\DSLTools\DslProjectsMigrationTool.exe**  
  
## Before you Migrate your DSL Projects  
 The migration tool modifies [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project files (**.csproj**) and solution files (**.sln**).  
  
#### To prepare projects for migration.  
  
-   Make sure the **.csproj** and **.sln** files can be written. If they are under source control, make sure that they are checked out.  
  
-   Make a copy of the folders you intend to migrate.  
  
## Migrating a Collection of Projects  
  
#### To Migrate DSL Projects and Solutions to Visual Studio 2010  
  
1.  Start the DSL Migration Tool.  
  
    -   You can double-click the tool in Windows Explorer (or File Explorer), or start the tool from a command prompt. The tool is in this location:  
  
         **%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SDK\VisualStudioIntegration\Tools\DSLTools\DslProjectsMigrationTool.exe**  
  
2.  Choose a folder that contains solutions and projects that you want to convert.  
  
    -   Enter the path in the box at the top of the tool, or click **Browse**.  
  
     The migration tool displays a tree of projects that define or use DSLs. The tree includes every project that uses the **Microsoft.VisualStudio.Modeling.Sdk** or **TextTemplating** assemblies.  
  
3.  Review the tree of projects, and uncheck projects that you do not want to convert.  
  
    -   Select a project or solution to see a list of changes that the tool will make.  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  The checkboxes that appear next to folder names have no effect. You must expand the folders to inspect the projects and solutions.  
  
4.  Convert the projects.  
  
    1.  Click **Convert**.  
  
         Before each project file is converted, a copy of *project***.csproj** is saved as *project***.vs2008.csproj**  
  
         A copy of each *solution***.sln** is saved as *solution***.vs2008.sln**  
  
    2.  Investigate any failed conversions that are reported.  
  
         Failures are reported in the text window. In addition, the tree view shows a red flag on each node that has failed to convert. You can click the node to get more information about that failure.  
  
5.  **Transform All Templates** in solutions containing successfully converted projects.  
  
    1.  Open the solution.  
  
    2.  Click the **Transform All Templates** button in the header of Solution Explorer.  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  You can make this step unnecessary. For more information, see [How to Automate Transform All Templates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b63cfe20-fe5e-47cc-9506-59b29bca768a).  
  
6.  Update your custom code in the converted projects.  
  
    -   Attempt to build the projects, and investigate any failures.  
  
    -   Test your designer.
