# Modeling SDK for Visual Studio - Domain-Specific Languages
By using the Modeling SDK for [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] (MSDK), you can create powerful model-based development tools that you can integrate into [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. As an example, the UML tools are created using MSDK. In the same manner, you can create one or more model definitions and integrate them into a set of tools.  
  
 At the heart of MSDK is the definition of a model that you create to represent concepts in your business area. You can surround the model with a variety of tools, such as a diagrammatic view, the ability to generate code and other artifacts, commands for transforming the model, and the ability to interact with code and other objects in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. As you develop the model, you can combine it with other models and tools to form a powerful toolset that is centered on your development.  
  
 MSDK lets you develop a model quickly in the form of a domain-specific language (DSL). You begin by using a specialized editor to define a schema or abstract syntax together with a graphical notation. From this definition, VMSDK generates:  
  
-   A model implementation with a strongly-typed API that runs in a transaction-based store.  
  
-   A tree-based explorer.  
  
-   A graphical editor in which users can view the model or parts of it that you define.  
  
-   Serialization methods that save your models in readable XML.  
  
-   Facilities for generating program code and other artifacts using text templating.  
  
 You can customize and extend all of these features. Your extensions are integrated in such a way that you can still update the DSL definition and re-generate the features without losing your extensions.
