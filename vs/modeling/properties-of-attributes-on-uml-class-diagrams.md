# Properties of attributes on UML class diagrams
On a UML class diagram, you can add *attributes* to classes and interfaces. An attribute defines values that can be attached to instances of the class or interface.  
  
 To add an attribute, right-click the class or interface, point to **Add**, and then click **Attribute**.  
  
 If the attributes of a class on the diagram are not visible, click the chevron at the top of the class or interface to expand it. If you can see the **Attributes** header, click **[+]** to expand the attributes section.  
  
## Signature of an Attribute  
 An attribute's signature is the line that represents it in a class or interface on a UML class diagram. It has this form:  
  
```  
+ AttributeName : TypeName [*]  
```  
  
 \+ denotes public Visibility. The other permitted values are - (private), # (protected), ~ (package).  
  
 `AttributeName` is underlined if the attribute is static.  
  
 `: TypeName` is omitted if the attribute has no type.  
  
 `[*]` denotes the multiplicity. It is omitted if the multiplicity is 1.  
  
## Properties  
 The following table describes the properties of an attribute in a class or interface on a UML class diagram.  
  
 To see the properties of an attribute, right-click the attribute in the class or interface on the diagram, and then click **Properties**. The properties appear in the Properties window.  
  
 To view the properties of an attribute, right-click it and then click **Properties**.  
  
|**Property**|**Default**|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
|**Default Value**|(empty)|The value of the attribute when the classifier is instantiated.|  
|**Is Read Only**|False|If true, the value of the attribute cannot be changed.|  
|**Is Static**|False|If true, a single value for this attribute is shared between all instances of this type.<br /><br /> If true, the name of the attribute is underlined where it appears on the diagram.|  
|**Name**|(a new name)|Should be unique within the owning classifier.|  
|**Type**|(none)|A primitive type such as **Integer**, or a type that is defined in the model. You cannot use non-primitive types such as **Decimal** because the value must be encoded in the metadata. If you enter a name for a new type in this property, a type will be added to the **Unspecified Types** section of UML Model Explorer.|  
|**Visibility**|Public|The permitted values, and the characters that appear in the signature are as follows:<br /><br /> **+ Public** - visible globally<br /><br /> **- Private** - not visible outside the owning type<br /><br /> **# Protected** - visible to types derived from the owner<br /><br /> **~ Package** - visible to other types within the same package.|  
|**Work Items**|0 associated|Count of associated work items. Read-only.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Link model elements and work items](../modeling/link-model-elements-and-work-items.md).|  
|**Is Leaf**|False|If true, it is not intended to allow redefinition of this attribute in derived types.|  
|**Is Derived**|False|If true, this attribute is calculated from other attributes. For example, Diagonal, calculated from Width and Height. The details should be written in the **Description** or an attached Comment.|  
|**Description**|(empty)|For general notes, or for defining constraints on the values in the attribute.|  
|**Multiplicity**|1|**1** - this attribute has a single value of the specified Type.<br /><br /> **0..1** - this attribute can have a value of `null`.<br /><br /> **\*** - this attribute's value is a collection of values.<br /><br /> **1..\*** - this attribute's value is a collection that contains at least one value.<br /><br /> *n* **..** *m* - this attribute's value is a collection that contains between *n* and *m* values.|  
|**Is Ordered**|False|If true, the collection forms a sequential list. For **Multiplicity** of more than 1.|  
|**Is Unique**|False|If true, there are no duplicate values in the collection. For **Multiplicity** of more than 1.|
