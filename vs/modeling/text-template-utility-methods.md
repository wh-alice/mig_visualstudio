# Text Template Utility Methods
There are several methods that are always available to you when you write code in a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] text template. These methods are defined in <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.TextTransformation>.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  You can also use other methods and services provided by the host environment in a regular (not preprocessed) text template. For example, you can resolve file paths, log errors, and get services provided by [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and any loaded packages.  For more information, see [Accessing Visual Studio from a Text Template](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/0556f20c-fef4-41a9-9597-53afab4ab9e4).  
  
## Write methods  
 You can use the `Write()` and `WriteLine()` methods to append text inside a standard code block, instead of using an expression code block. The following two code blocks are functionally equivalent.  
  
##### Code block with an expression block  
  
```  
<#  
int i = 10;  
while (i-- > 0)  
    { #>  
        <#= i #>  
    <# }  
#>  
```  
  
##### Code block using WriteLine()  
  
```  
<#   
    int i = 10;  
    while (i-- > 0)  
    {   
        WriteLine((i.ToString()));  
    }  
#>  
```  
  
 You may find it helpful to use one of these utility methods instead of an expression block inside a long code block with nested control structures.  
  
 The `Write()` and `WriteLine()` methods have two overloads, one that takes a single string parameter and one that takes a composite format string plus an array of objects to include in the string (like the `Console.WriteLine()` method). The following two uses of `WriteLine()` are functionally equivalent:  
  
```  
<#  
    string msg = "Say: {0}, {1}, {2}";  
    string s1 = "hello";  
    string s2 = "goodbye";  
    string s3 = "farewell";  
  
    WriteLine(msg, s1, s2, s3);  
    WriteLine("Say: hello, goodbye, farewell");  
#>   
```  
  
## Indentation methods  
 You can use indentation methods to format the output of your text template. The <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.TextTransformation> class has a `CurrentIndent` string property that shows the current indentation in the text template and an `indentLengths` field that is a list of the indentations that have been added. You can add an indentation with the `PushIndent()` method and subtract an indentation with the `PopIndent()` method. If you want to remove all indentations, use the `ClearIndent()` method. The following code block shows the use of these methods:  
  
```  
<#  
    WriteLine(CurrentIndent + "Hello");  
    PushIndent("    ");  
    WriteLine(CurrentIndent + "Hello");  
    PushIndent("    ");  
    WriteLine(CurrentIndent + "Hello");  
    ClearIndent();  
    WriteLine(CurrentIndent + "Hello");  
    PushIndent("    ");  
    WriteLine(CurrentIndent + "Hello");  
#>  
```  
  
 This code block produces the following output:  
  
```  
Hello  
        Hello  
                Hello  
Hello  
        Hello  
```  
  
## Error and warning methods  
 You can use error and warning utility methods to add messages to the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Error List. For example, the following code will add an error message to the Error List.  
  
```  
<#  
  try  
  {  
    string str = null;  
    Write(str.Length.ToString());  
  }  
  catch (Exception e)  
  {  
    Error(e.Message);  
  }  
#>    
```  
  
## Access to Host and Service Provider  
 The property `this.Host` can provide access to properties exposed by the host that is executing the template. To use `this.Host`, you must set `hostspecific` attribute in the `<@template#>` directive:  
  
 `<#@template ... hostspecific="true" #>`  
  
 The type of `this.Host` depends on the type of host in which the template is executing. In a template that is running in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], you can cast `this.Host` to `IServiceProvider` to gain access to services such as the IDE. For example:  
  
```  
EnvDTE.DTE dte = (EnvDTE.DTE) ((IServiceProvider) this.Host)  
                       .GetService(typeof(EnvDTE.DTE));  
```  
  
## Using a different set of utility methods  
 As part of the text generation process, your template file is transformed into a class, which is always named `GeneratedTextTransformation`and inherits from <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.TextTransformation>. If you want to use a different set of methods instead, you can write your own class and specify it in the template directive. Your class must inherit from <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.TextTransformation>.  
  
```  
<#@ template inherits="MyUtilityClass" #>  
```  
  
 Use the `assembly` directive to reference the assembly where the compiled class can be found.
