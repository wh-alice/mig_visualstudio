# How to: Add a Threshold Rule Using the Load Test Editor
Threshold rules in load tests compare a performance counter value with either a constant value or another performance counter value.  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
-   Visual Studio Enterprise  
  
## Adding a Threshold Rule  
  
#### To add a threshold rule  
  
1.  Open a load test.  
  
2.  In the Load Test Editor, expand the **Counter Sets** node.  
  
3.  Expand one of the **Counter Categories** in one of the Counter Sets. For example, you can select **LoadTest:Scenario**. Expand the node.  
  
4.  Right-click one of the counters, for example, **User Load**, under **LoadTest:Scenario**. Select **Add Threshold Rule**.  
  
     The **Add Threshold Rule** dialog box is displayed.  
  
5.  You can choose from two types of rules: Compare Constant and Compare Counter. Select the appropriate type and set the values.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Set the **Alert If Over** property to **True** to indicate that exceeding a threshold is a problem. Set the **Alert If Over** property to **False** to indicate that falling below a threshold is a problem.
