# Setting Up Your Test Run Sequence Using Ordered Tests
An ordered test contains other tests that are meant to be run in a specified order. An ordered test is displayed as a single test in Test Explorer. Its results appear in a single row in the Test Results window, but you can obtain individual results for each test that was run as a part of the ordered test.  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
-   Visual Studio Enterprise
