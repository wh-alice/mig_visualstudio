# State Machine Activity Designers
[!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflowdesigner/includes/wfd1_md.md)] includes a number of activity designers that you can use when constructing your workflows. This section contains the system-provided activity designers used to create and manage state machine workflows. The following topics describe these designers and provide guidance on how to use them.  
  
## In This Section  
 [StateMachine](../workflowdesigner/statemachine-activity-designer.md)  
 Contains a collection of states and models workflows using the familiar state machine paradigm.  
  
 [State](../workflowdesigner/state-activity-designer.md)  
 Represents a state in which a state machine can be in.  
  
 [FinalState](../workflowdesigner/finalstate-activity-designer.md)  
 Represents a state that terminates a state machine instance.  
  
 [Transition](../workflowdesigner/transition-activity-designer.md)  
 Represents the transition between two states.
