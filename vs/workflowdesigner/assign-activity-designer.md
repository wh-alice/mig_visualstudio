# Assign Activity Designer
The **Assign** activity designer is used to create and configure an <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign> activity.  
  
## The Assign Activity  
 The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign> activity assigns a value to a variable or argument.  
  
### Using the Assign Activity Designer  
 The **Assign** activity designer can be found in the **Primitives** category of the **Toolbox**, which is accessed by clicking the **Toolbox** tab (Alternatively, select **Toolbox** from the **View** menu or CTRL+ALT+X.)  
  
 The **Assign** activity designer can be dragged from the **Toolbox** and dropped on to the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflowdesigner/includes/wfd2_md.md)] surface where ever activities are usually placed, such as inside a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence>. This creates an <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign> activity with a default **DisplayName** of Assign. The <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName*> can be edited in the header of the **Assign** activity designer or in the **DisplayName** box of the property grid.  
  
### The Assign Properties  
 The following table shows the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign> properties and describes how they are used in the designer. These properties can be edited in property grid and some of them can be edited on [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflowdesigner/includes/wfd2_md.md)] surface.  
  
|Property Name|Required|Usage|  
|-------------------|--------------|-----------|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName*>|False|The friendly name of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign> activity. The default is Assign. Although the <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName*> value is not strictly required, it is a best practice to use one.|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign.To*>|True|The variable or argument to which the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign.Value*> is assigned. This must be a valid Visual Basic identifier. To set the property, type a Visual Basic expression in the **To** box on the **Assign** activity designer or in the property grid.|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign.Value*>|True|The value that is assigned to the variable. To set the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign.Value*>, type a Visual Basic expression in the **Value** box on the **Assign** activity designer or in the property grid.|
