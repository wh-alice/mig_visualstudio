# Delay Activity Designer
The **Delay** activity designer is used to create and configure a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Delay> activity.  
  
## The Delay Activity  
 The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Delay> activity delays the execution of a workflow for a specified amount of time.  
  
### Using the Delay Activity Designer  
 The **Delay** activity designer can be found in the **Primitives** category of the **Toolbox**, which is accessed by clicking the **Toolbox** tab of the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflowdesigner/includes/wfd2_md.md)] (Alternatively, select **Toolbar** from the **View** menu, or CTRL+ALT+X.)  
  
 The **Delay** activity designer can be dragged from the **Toolbox** and dropped on to the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflowdesigner/includes/wfd2_md.md)] surface wherever activities are usually placed, such as inside a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence>. This creates a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Delay> activity with a default <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName*> of Delay. The <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName*> can be edited in the header of the **Delay** activity designer or in the **DisplayName** box of the property grid.  
  
### The Delay Properties  
 The following table shows the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Delay> properties and describes how they are used in the designer. These properties can be edited in property grid and of them some can be edited on [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflowdesigner/includes/wfd2_md.md)]designer surface.  
  
|Property Name|Required|Usage|  
|-------------------|--------------|-----------|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName*>|False|The friendly name of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Delay> activity. The default is Delay. Although the <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName*> value is not strictly required, it is a best practice to use one.|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.Delay.Duration*>|True|The amount of time to delay the workflow. This property is set in the property grid. Type in either a literal <xref:System.TimeSpan> in the format 00:00:00 or a Visual Basic expression to specify the amount of time.|
