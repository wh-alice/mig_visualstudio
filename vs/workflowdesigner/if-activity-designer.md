# If Activity Designer
The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If> activity evaluates a condition and executes an activity depending on the results of that evaluation. This activity is most useful when using a procedural modeling style of programming. An <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If> activity can be nested inside a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity or a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Parallel> activity, for example. If you are using a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> activity, consider using a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowDecision> activity instead.  
  
## If Properties in the Workflow Designer  
 The following table shows the most useful <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If> activity properties and describes how to use them in the designer.  
  
|Property Name|Required|Usage|  
|-------------------|--------------|-----------|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.If.Condition*>|True|The condition that determines which child activity to execute. To set the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If.Condition*>, type a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../codequality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] expression in the **Condition** box on the **If** activity designer or in the property grid.|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.If.Else*>|False|The activity to execute if the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If.Condition*> is **false**. To add an activity that is executed by the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If.Else*> branch, drop an activity from the **Toolbox** into the **Else** box on the **If** activity designer with hint text “Drop Activity Here”.|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.If.Then*>|False|The activity to execute if the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If.Condition*> is **true**. To add an activity that is executed by the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If.Then*> branch, drop an activity from the **Toolbox** into the **Then** box on the **If** activity designer with hint text “Drop Activity Here”.|
