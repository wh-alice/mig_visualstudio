# How to: Use the Argument Designer
Compared to previous versions of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../codequality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)], the argument designer makes it easy to allow data to flow into and out of an activity. The designer is accessed by clicking the **Arguments** button in the lower-left corner of the design canvas. The designer contains a list of arguments that appear in a tabular form and can be sorted by each of the column headers, except for the **Default value** column. Each argument contains a name, in/out/in-out/property direction, type, and default expression value (if any). The name and the default expression value are editable text fields, and the type and direction are drop-downs. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../codequality/includes/crabout_md.md)] arguments, see [Variables and Arguments](../Topic/Variables%20and%20Arguments.md).  
  
### To create a new argument  
  
1.  Open a workflow or activity solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../codequality/includes/vs2010_md.md)].  
  
2.  Open the arguments designer by clicking the **Arguments** button in the lower-left corner of the design canvas. The arguments designer appears.  
  
3.  Click the empty row labeled **Create Argument**. This will add a new row with a new argument using the following default values: argumentx for the **Name** where x is an integer with an initial value of 1 that is automatically incremented to create unique argument names, **In** for the **Direction**, and **String** for the **Argument type**. No value is added for **Default value**. You can change these values at any time during the workflow design process.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  To delete an argument, select the argument by clicking it and then press the **Delete** key.
