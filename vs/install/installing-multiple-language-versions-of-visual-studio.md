# Installing Multiple Language Versions of Visual Studio
By installing one or more language packages, you can run Visual Studio in other languages on the same computer. You must obtain a separate language package for each language that you want to install.  
  
## Important Considerations  
  
-   When you install a language package, resource files for the installed features are automatically installed for each language version.  
  
-   Visual Studio service packages apply to all installed language versions of Visual Studio. You no longer need to install a service package for each language version of Visual Studio that you've installed.  
  
-   You can uninstall language packages by using the maintenance mode of Visual Studio setup. Open **Control Panel**, open **Programs and Features**, choose your edition of Visual Studio, and then choose **Uninstall/Change**.
