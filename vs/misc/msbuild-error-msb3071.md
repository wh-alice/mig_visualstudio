# MSBuild Error MSB3071
**All drive letters from A: to Z: are currently in use. Since the working directory "'\<path>'" is a UNC path, The "Exec" task needs a free drive letter to map the UNC path to. Disconnect from one or more shared resources to free up drive letters, or specify a local working directory before attempting this command again.**  
  
 All drive letters from A: through Z: are currently in use. Because the specified working directory is a UNC path, the `Exec` task needs a free drive letter to which to map the UNC path to.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Disconnect from one or more shared resources to free drive letters  
  
-   Specify a local working directory before attempting this command again.
