# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.MissingMemberException
A <xref:System.MissingMemberException> exception is thrown when there is an attempt to dynamically access a class member that does not exist.  
  
## Associated Tips  
 **If a member in a class library has been removed or renamed, recompile any assemblies that reference that library.**  
 This exception is typically thrown when a field or method is deleted or renamed in one assembly, and the change is not reflected in a second assembly that is trying to access the missing member.  
  
 **If you are attempting to access members on a late-bound object variable, make sure it is declared Public.**  
 `Protected`, `Friend`, and `Private` variables cannot be late-bound in Visual Basic.
