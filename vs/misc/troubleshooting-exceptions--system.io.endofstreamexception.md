# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.IO.EndOfStreamException
An <xref:System.IO.EndOfStreamException> exception is thrown when there is an attempt to read past the end of a stream.  
  
## Associated Tips  
 **Check whether the end of the file has been reached before reading.**  
 Use the <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.Peek*> method to check the end of the file before reading from the stream.
