# VSPackage State
Many factors determine the set of persisted values, or state, of a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] application.  
  
-   Projects have project and configuration properties.  
  
-   Solutions have properties.  
  
-   User settings determine the size and position of document windows, tool windows, docking state, and keyboard shortcuts.  
  
-   Applications can have options that a user sets.  
  
-   Objects that an application creates can have properties of their own.  
  
 Here are some of the ways that a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] application state can be managed:  
  
-   Through the project and solution property pages.  
  
-   Through the **Import and Export Settings Wizard**, which enables a user to move settings from one computer to another.  
  
-   Through the **Options** dialog box, which includes options related to applications.  
  
-   Through the **Properties** window, which exposes properties of objects.  
  
-   Through Automation. An application can access VSPackage and object properties that have been exposed to Automation.  
  
 Underlying the application state are various persistence mechanisms that enable the application state to be saved and restored.
