# Compiler Error CS1056
Unexpected character 'character'  
  
 The C# compiler encountered an unexpected character, and is unable to identify the token currently being processed. For example, if the compiler encounters a Euro-character in the middle of processing an identifier, it will be unable to classify the identifier, since a Euro-character would only be valid inside a string, and the compiler knows it is not processing a string.
