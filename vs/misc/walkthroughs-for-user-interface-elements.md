# Walkthroughs for User Interface Elements
You can add menus and toolbars to many different user interface (UI) elements of your VSPackage or the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE). The walkthroughs in this section lead you through the most common scenarios.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Adding a Menu to the Visual Studio Menu Bar](../extensibility/adding-a-menu-to-the-visual-studio-menu-bar.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a menu from a VSPackage to the same level as the top level menu items of the IDE (such as **File**, **Edit**, **Help**).  
  
 [Adding a Submenu to a Menu](../extensibility/adding-a-submenu-to-a-menu.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a submenu to an existing menu.  
  
 [Adding a Most Recently Used List to a Submenu](../extensibility/adding-a-most-recently-used-list-to-a-submenu.md)  
 Demonstrates how to support a dynamic menu list in a submenu that is the basis of a Most Recently Used (MRU) menu.  
  
 [Adding a Toolbar](../extensibility/adding-a-toolbar.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a toolbar to the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] IDE.  
  
 [Adding a Toolbar to a Tool Window](../extensibility/adding-a-toolbar-to-a-tool-window.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a toolbar to a tool window.  
  
 [Adding a Menu Controller to a Toolbar](../extensibility/adding-a-menu-controller-to-a-toolbar.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a menu controller to a toolbar. A menu controller is a button that contains a default command and an arrow that reveals a drop down menu list where additional commands can be selected.  
  
 [Dynamically Adding Menu Items](../extensibility/dynamically-adding-menu-items.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add menu items dynamically.  
  
 [Adding a Shortcut Menu in a Tool Window](../extensibility/adding-a-shortcut-menu-in-a-tool-window.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a context (that is, right-click) menu to a tool window. In this case, a gradient service tool window.
