# MSBuild Error MSB3481
**MSB3481: The signing certificate could not be located. Ensure that it is in the current user's personal store.**  
  
 This error is generated when the signing certificate was not found in your personal certificate store. This error is similar to [MSBuild Error MSB3486](../misc/msbuild-error-msb3486.md), which means that the certificate was found, but does not match.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure that a valid certificate that matches your project's .pfx file is in your personal certificate store.
