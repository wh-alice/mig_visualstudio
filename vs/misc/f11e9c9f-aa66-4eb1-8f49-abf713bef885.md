# Operands of type Object used in expressions for &#39;Select&#39;, &#39;Case&#39; statements; runtime errors could occur
A `Select`...`Case` construction uses one or more expressions of the [Object Data Type](../Topic/Object%20Data%20Type.md).  
  
 When a variable or expression evaluates to `Object`, the compiler must perform *late binding*, which causes extra operations at run time. It also exposes your application to potential run-time errors. For example, if you assign a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> to an `Object` variable and then try to compare it with a number, the runtime throws an <xref:System.InvalidCastException> because Visual Basic cannot convert a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> object to a numeric value.  
  
 The expressions in a `Select`...`Case` construction should all be of the same data type or of closely related data types that can be converted to each other. This is because each `Case` statement compares at least one value against the test expression on which the `Select`...`Case` construction is based.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](../ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42036  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   If possible, arrange all the expressions to evaluate to data types for which comparison operators are defined.
