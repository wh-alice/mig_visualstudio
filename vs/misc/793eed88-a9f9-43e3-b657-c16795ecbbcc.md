# Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the &#39;If&#39; operator
Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the 'If' operator. One must have a widening conversion to the other.  
  
 When the `If` operator is called with three arguments, there must be a widening conversion between the second and third arguments. For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between `Integer` and `String`, the following code causes this error.  
  
```vb#  
Dim divisor = 3  
' Not valid.  
' Console.WriteLine(If(divisor <> 0, number \ divisor, "Division by zero"))  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33106  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Provide an explicit conversion for one of the operands, if that is possible in your code.  
  
-   Use a different condition construction, such as an `If...Then...Else` statement.
