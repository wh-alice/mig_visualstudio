# Unable to sign assembly: &lt;error message&gt;
The [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] compiler calls the Assembly Linker (Al.exe, also known as Alink) to generate an assembly with a manifest. The linker has reported an error signing the assembly after it was created. This might be due to an invalid key.
