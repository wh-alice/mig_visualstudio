# &#39;&lt;procedurename&gt;&#39; method for event &#39;&lt;eventname&gt;&#39; cannot be marked CLS compliant because its containing type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; is not CLS compliant
A custom event declares an `AddHandler` or `RemoveHandler` procedure and marks it as `<CLSCompliant(True)>`, but the event is defined in a type that is marked as `<CLSCompliant(False)>` or is not marked.  
  
 When you apply \<xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  
  
 If you do not apply \<xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](../ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40053  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   If you require CLS compliance, define the event within a type that is CLS compliant.  
  
-   If you require that the event remain within its containing type, remove \<xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> from its definition or mark it as `<CLSCompliant(False)>`.
