# Visual Studio Library Overview
Visual Studio Library is a set of template-based C++ classes for simplifying the creation of VSPackages in native C++. Visual Studio Library includes complete source code, as a set of C++ header files. The header files are installed in *Visual Studio SDK installation path*\VisualStudioIntegration \Common\Source\CPP\VSL\Include\\.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Visual Studio Library relies on the Active Template Library (ATL) for its support of COM objects. For more information, see [Introduction to ATL](../Topic/Introduction%20to%20ATL.md).  
  
 Visual Studio Library supports unit testing, both for its own code and for your code. Some unit tests are included, as follows:  
  
-   Visual Studio Library unit tests are installed in *Visual Studio SDK installation path*\VisualStudioIntegration\Common\Source\CPP\VSL\UnitTest\\.  
  
-   The base classes for unit tests for your code are in *Visual Studio SDK installation path*\VisualStudioIntegration\Common\Source\CPP\VSL\Include\VSLUnitTest.h.  
  
 Mock implementations of commonly-used COM and Visual Studio interfaces are in the header files, VSLMockSystemInterfaces.h and VSLMockVisualStudioInterfaces.h, which are installed in *Visual Studio SDK installation path*\VisualStudioIntegration\Common\Source\CPP\VSL\Include\\.
