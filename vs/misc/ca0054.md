 `<Rules FriendlyName="Customer Rules">`  
  
 `<Rule TypeName="[The unqualified type name of the rule]" Category="[A category name such as Customer.Usage]" CheckId="[An identifier for the rule that is at least unique within the same category]">`  
  
 `<Name>[Localized version of the type name, this is the rule name that appears in the UI]</Name>`  
  
 `<Description>[A sentence describing the rule in more detail than the name].</Description>`  
  
 `<Url>[A URL pointing to a documentation or info about the rule]</Url>`  
  
 `<Resolution>[Format string for rule messages].</Resolution>`  
  
 `<Email>[Email Address]</Email>`  
  
 `<MessageLevel Certainty="[A number from 0 to 100]">[Error or Warning]</MessageLevel>`  
  
 `<FixCategories>[NonBreaking or Breaking]</FixCategories>`  
  
 `<Owner>[Rule owner name or group]</Owner>`
