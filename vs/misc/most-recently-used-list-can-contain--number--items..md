# Most recently used list can contain &lt;number&gt; items.
MRU lists can contain up to twenty-four items. This error generally occurs when a number less than one or greater than twenty-four has been entered in the **Most recently used lists contain \<number> items** box on the General pane of Environment options in the Options dialog box.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Enter a number between one and twenty-four in the box.
