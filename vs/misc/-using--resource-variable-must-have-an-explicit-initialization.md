# &#39;Using&#39; resource variable must have an explicit initialization
A `Using` statement specifies at least one resource that it does not initialize with a `New` clause.  
  
 If you have not already acquired the resource before passing control to the `Using` block, the `Using` statement must acquire the resource. To do this, it must create an object from the specified class, which requires a `New` clause.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36011  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   If you have already acquired the resource, use a reference variable or expression in the `Using` statement that evaluates to the acquired resource.  
  
     `Dim newFont As New System.Drawing.Font`  
  
     `Using newFont`  
  
-   If you have not already acquired the resource, add a `New` clause to the `Using` statement.  
  
     `Using newFont as`   `New`   `System.Drawing.Font`
