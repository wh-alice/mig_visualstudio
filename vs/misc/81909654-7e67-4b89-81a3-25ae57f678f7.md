# &#39;&lt;derivedtypename&gt;&#39; cannot inherit from &lt;type&gt; &#39;&lt;constructedbasetypename&gt;&#39; because it expands the access of type &#39;&lt;internaltypename&gt;&#39; outside the assembly
A derived class or interface attempts to expand the access level of a restricted type by using it as a type argument to a base class or interface.  
  
 The following code can generate this error.  
  
```  
Public Class baseClass(Of t)  
End Class  
Public Class derivedClass  
    Inherits baseClass(Of restrictedStructure)  
End Class  
Friend Structure restrictedStructure  
    Dim firstMember As Integer  
End Structure  
```  
  
 Code outside the assembly is not allowed to access `restrictedStructure`. However, `derivedClass` can be accessed from any code that can reference it. Therefore, `derivedClass` cannot inherit `baseClass` if it uses `restrictedStructure` as a type argument, because that could expose `restrictedStructure` to code in any assembly.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30922  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Adjust the access levels of the classes or interfaces so the derived type does not expand the access level of the restricted type.  
  
     -or-  
  
-   If you cannot adjust the access levels, do not use the restricted type as a type argument when constructing the base class or interface.
