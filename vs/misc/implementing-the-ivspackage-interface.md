# Implementing the IVsPackage Interface
All VSPackages must implement the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPackage> interface. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] calls the methods of <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPackage> to initialize and close VSPackages, to get associated property pages, and for other reasons. The <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPackage> interface is the gateway interface between [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and a VSPackage.  
  
 You can write a managed VSPackage as a subclass of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package> class, which implements <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPackage> on your behalf. For more information, see [Managed VSPackages](../misc/managed-vspackages.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Much of the unmanaged sample code in the Visual Studio Integration section of the [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../extensibility/includes/vsipsdk_md.md)] uses the Active Template Library (ATL). You do not need to use ATL to create VSPackages, but you must understand ATL to understand the sample code.
