# Operators cannot be declared &#39;&lt;keyword&gt;&#39;
An operator is declared with a keyword that is not valid for operator definitions.  
  
 Every operator must be declared as both [Public](../Topic/Public%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md) and [Shared](../Topic/Shared%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md). In addition, a conversion operator must be declared with either [Widening](../Topic/Widening%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md) or [Narrowing](../Topic/Narrowing%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md), but not both. An operator definition can optionally include the [Overloads](../Topic/Overloads%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md) or [Shadows](../Topic/Shadows%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md) keywords. No other keywords are permitted in an [Operator Statement](../Topic/Operator%20Statement.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33013  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the invalid keyword from the operator definition.
