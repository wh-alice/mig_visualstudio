# Automation Model
The automation model provides an alternative to VSPackages for extending [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. Known in earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] as the extensibility model, the automation model is a programming interface that gives you access to the underlying routines that drive the integrated development environment (IDE), and lets you customize, adjust, and automate it.  
  
## VSPackages and Automation  
 The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] SDK documentation focuses on VSPackages, which offer more development potential than the automation model. For example, you can write code against the objects in the automation model to customize a language, such as [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]. However, you cannot add a new language to the IDE by using the automation model. To add a new language to the environment, you must develop a VSPackage.  
  
 Together, the automation model and the VSPackage model compose a two-pronged approach to extensibility in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. Extensibility is the capacity to enhance and extend the functionality of the IDE. Automation refers to user-created code and tools that automate tasks in the existing environment and programmatically drive the IDE. VSPackages, on the other hand, let you add new functionality to the IDE. A VSPackage is a co-creatable object; that is, it has a class factory and makes itself available to the IDE by implementing the interface <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPackage>.  
  
 Add-ins and wizards use the automation model to control or extend the functionality of the IDE by using its automation interfaces. Typically, Microsoft includes many add-ins with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. You can use add-ins to integrate new commands on the toolbars and menus, to add tool windows, or to automate certain tasks that you perform regularly in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  
  
 As a VSPackage developer, you should contribute to the automation model. For example, if you add a new language to [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] by using the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] SDK, your language should provide a robust code model that extends the pre-existing one.
