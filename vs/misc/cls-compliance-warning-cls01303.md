# CLS Compliance Warning CLS01303
A CLS-compliant literal must have a value specified in field initialization metadata that is exactly the same as the literal (or of the underlying type, if that literal is an enum)  
  
 The value of a literal static is specified through the use of field initialization metadata. A CLS-compliant literal must have a value specified in field initialization metadata that is exactly the same as the literal (or of the underlying type, if that literal is an enum).  
  
 Make sure that the field literal has exactly the same type as the literal (or underlying type, if the literal is an enum).  
  
 For more information CLS compliance checking, see [CLS Compliant Assemblies](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3320b57e-ea55-4697-a17d-f509a36a3c93).  
  
 The following declaration (using MSIL assembly language) shows what could cause CLS01303:  
  
```  
.field public static literal char Field2 = int32(0x00000002)  
```  
  
 By making the type of the initializer the same as the literal type, you can resolve this warning:  
  
```  
.field public static literal char Field2 = char(0x00000002)  
```
