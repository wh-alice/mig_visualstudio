# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.IO.FileLoadException
A <xref:System.IO.FileLoadException> exception is thrown when a managed assembly is found but cannot be loaded.  
  
## Associated Tips  
 **Make sure that the file is a valid .NET Framework assembly.**  
 This exception is thrown if the file is not a valid .NET Framework assembly. For more information, see <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly>.  
  
 **Check to make sure an assembly or module was not loaded twice with two different evidences.**  
 Evidence is the set of information that constitutes input to security policy decisions, such as what permissions can be granted to code. For more information, see <xref:System.EnterpriseServices.Internal.Publish.GacRemove*> and <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.Evidence*>  
  
 **If using the RegisterAssembly or UnregisterAssembly methods, check to make sure the assembly name is not longer than MAX_PATH characters.**  
 The assembly name's length cannot exceed MAX_PATH. For more information, see <xref:System.EnterpriseServices.Internal.IComSoapPublisher.RegisterAssembly*> and <xref:System.EnterpriseServices.Internal.IComSoapPublisher.UnRegisterAssembly*>.  
  
 **If loading a satellite assembly, make sure the specified CultureInfo matches the file's CultureInfo.**  
 Satellite assemblies contain localized resources which contain non-localizable executable code and resources for a single culture that serve as the default or neutral culture. For more information, see <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.GetSatelliteAssembly*>.
