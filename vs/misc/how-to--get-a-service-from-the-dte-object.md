# How to: Get a Service from the DTE Object
A service can be obtained from any program that has access to the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Automation \<xref:EnvDTE.DTEClass> object. For example, you can access the \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsActivityLog> service from a wizard through the DTE object. You can use this service to write to the activity log. For more information, see [How to: Use the Activity Log](../extensibility/how-to--use-the-activity-log.md).  
  
 The DTE object implements \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IServiceProvider>, which you can use to query for a service from managed code by using \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.ServiceProvider.GetService*>.  
  
### To get a service from the DTE object  
  
1.  The following code creates a \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.ServiceProvider> from the DTE object and calls \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.ServiceProvider.GetService*> with the type of the \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsActivityLog> service. The service is cast to the interface \<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsActivityLog>, which is used to write an entry in the activity log. For more information abou how to write to the activity log, see [How to: Use the Activity Log](../extensibility/how-to--use-the-activity-log.md).
