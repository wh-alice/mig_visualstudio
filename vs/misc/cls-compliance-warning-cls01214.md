# CLS Compliance Warning CLS01214
The visibility and accessibility of types and members shall be such that types in the signature of any member shall be visible and accessible whenever the member itself is visible and accessible. For example, a delegate that is visible outside its assembly shall not have an argument whose type is visible only within the assembly.  
  
 Types in delegate signatures must have accessibility greater than or equal to that of the delegate.  For example, a delegate visible outside its assembly shall not have an argument whose type is visible only within the assembly.  
  
 For more information CLS compliance checking, see [CLS Compliant Assemblies](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3320b57e-ea55-4697-a17d-f509a36a3c93).  
  
 The following sample generates CLS01214:  
  
```  
/* CLS01214.cpp */  
// compile with: /clr /LD  
// CLS01214 expected  
using namespace System;  
using namespace System::Reflection;  
[assembly:CLSCompliant (true)];  
[assembly:AssemblyKeyFile("clscompliance.snk")];  
  
public ref class PublicType {};  
private ref class AssemblyType {};  
  
public delegate PublicType^ AssemblyDelegate(AssemblyType^ parameter);   // not cls compliant  
public delegate PublicType^ AssemblyDelegate2(PublicType^ parameter);   //cls compliant  
```
