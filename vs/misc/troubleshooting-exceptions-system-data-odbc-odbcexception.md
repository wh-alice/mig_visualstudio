# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.Data.Odbc.OdbcException
An <xref:System.Data.Odbc.OdbcException> exception is generated when a warning or error is returned by an ODBC data source.  
  
## Associated Tips  
 **Verify that you are connecting with valid credentials.**  
 Check your credentials to make sure they are valid.  
  
 **Verify that the server name is correct and that the server is running.**  
 Make sure that you are using the correct server name, and that the server is reachable.  
  
## Remarks  
 This exception is thrown whenever the <xref:System.Data.Odbc.OdbcDataAdapter> encounters an error generated by the server.  
  
 If the severity of the error is too great, the server may close the <xref:System.Data.Odbc.OdbcConnection>. However, the user can reopen the connection and continue.
