# Partial methods must have empty method bodies
The body of a partial method signature declaration must not contain any code. The following example shows a partial method signature and its implementation.  
  
```  
' Definition of the partial method signature.  
Partial Private Sub OnNameChanged()  
    ' The body of the signature is empty.  
End Sub  
```  
  
```  
' Implementation of the partial method.  
Private Sub OnNameChanged()  
    MsgBox("Name was changed to " & Me.Name)  
End Sub  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** 31435  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Remove any code from the partial method declaration.
