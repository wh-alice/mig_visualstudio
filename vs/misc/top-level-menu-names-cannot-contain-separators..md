# Top-level menu names cannot contain separators.
This error generally occurs when an attempt is made to drag text that contains a separator character, such as a dash (-), into a menu name. Top-level menus cannot contain this character, which is reserved for separating sets of menu items.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Enter the text without using the separator character.
