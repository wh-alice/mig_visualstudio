# The following components could not be browsed:
This message box can list multiple errors related to the Object Browser and Component Selection dialog box. The following errors are some of the most common.  
  
## Component or file type cannot be viewed in the Object Browser.  
 This error generally occurs when you specify a file name that does not exist or is not valid, or a file that cannot be browsed through the Object Browser.  
  
#### To correct this error  
  
-   Verify that the file name you specified exists and is a browsable component, such as a .NET assembly, COM type library, or a source browser file.  
  
## File is not a valid .NET Framework or COM component.  
 This error generally occurs when the component specified is not a .NET Framework assembly or a COM type library.  
  
#### To correct this error  
  
-   Choose a different component to browse.  
  
## File cannot be registered as a COM component.  
 This error generally occurs when the type library for a COM component cannot be registered. The type library might not exist or might be corrupted.  
  
#### To correct this error  
  
-   Reinstall the component and try again.  
  
## No matching type library is registered or the registered information is not valid.  
 The type library you have specified may no longer exist or may not contain valid information.  
  
#### To correct this error  
  
-   Verify that the type library exists and is correctly registered.  
  
## Components required to browse COM type libraries are missing or not registered correctly.  
 The file vstlbinf.dll is missing or incorrectly registered.  
  
#### To correct this issue  
  
1.  Find vstlbinf.dll on your machine and register it using regsvr32.exe.  
  
     —or—  
  
2.  If you cannot find vstlbinf.dll on your machine, reinstall this product.
