# MSBuild Error MSB3113
**MSB3113: Could not find file '\<file>'.**  
  
 This error is generated when an irresolvable reference is encountered when creating a new manifest. It might have originated from the project file or as a task parameter.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Check your project file (and build parameters, if you are custom building) for conflicts in file references.
