# At least one reference is missing the &#39;Name&#39; attribute
Each reference must have an associated **Name** property, as seen below:  
  
```  
<Reference  
   Name = "System.XML"  
   AssemblyName = "System.Xml"  
/>  
```  
  
 This error indicates that the **Name** property was not found for at least one reference.  
  
 This error is most likely caused by editing the project file by hand.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Add the reference again.  
  
     Any affected references will not be added to the project.
