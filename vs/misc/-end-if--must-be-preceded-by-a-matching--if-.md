# &#39;End If&#39; must be preceded by a matching &#39;If&#39;
An `End If` statement occurs without a corresponding `If` statement. `End If` must be preceded by an `If` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30087  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  If this `If` block is part of a set of nested `If` blocks, make sure each block is properly terminated.  
  
2.  Verify that other control structures within the `If` block are correctly terminated.  
  
3.  Ensure that this `If` block is correctly formatted.
