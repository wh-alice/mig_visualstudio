# Could not transform licenses file &#39;file&#39; into a binary resource. &lt;reason&gt;
The licenses processor used to transform .licx files into binary resources failed for some reason.  
  
 This error is typically caused by a bad .licx file. For example, the file may have been opened and modified in a text editor.  
  
 The build process will fail if this error occurs.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Select the project in Solution Explorer.  
  
2.  From the **Project** menu, click **Show All Files**.  
  
3.  In the Solution Explorer, expand the obj folder, and then expand the **Debug** folder.  
  
4.  Locate the file named "myApplication.exe.licenses" where myApplication is the name of your Windows Forms application.  
  
5.  Delete this file and rebuild the solution.
