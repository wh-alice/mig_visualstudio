# Virtual Base Class Hierarchies
Some class hierarchies are broad but have many things in common. The common code is implemented in a base class, whereas the specific code is in the derived classes.  
  
 It is important for the base classes to establish a protocol through which the derived classes can attain maximum functionality. These protocols are commonly implemented using virtual functions. Sometimes the base class provides a default implementation for such functions. In a class hierarchy such as the `Document` hierarchy in the figure Sample of Directed Acyclic Graph (see [Single Inheritance](../Topic/Single%20Inheritance.md)), two useful functions are `Identify` and `WhereIs`.  
  
 When called, the `Identify` function returns a correct identification, appropriate to the kind of document: For a `Book`, a function call such as `doc->Identify()` must return the ISBN number; however, for a `HelpFile`, a product name and revision number are probably more appropriate. Similarly, `WhereIs` should return a row and shelf for a `Book`, but for a `HelpFile` it should return a disk location â€” perhaps a directory and filename.  
  
 It is important that all implementations of the `Identify` and `WhereIs` functions return the same kind of information. In this case, a character string is appropriate.  
  
 These functions are implemented as virtual functions and then invoked using a pointer to a base class. The binding to the actual code occurs at run time, selecting the correct `Identify` or `WhereIs` function.
