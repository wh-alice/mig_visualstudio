# How to: Test the Help About and Splash Screens
After you implement **Help About** and splash screen support, you can test your implementation in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  
  
### To test the Help About dialog box  
  
1.  From the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] command prompt, run devenv.exe with the **/setup** switch. To run in the experimental environment, type:  
  
     **devenv /rootsuffix Exp /setup**  
  
     **Note** You have to repeat this step only when you change the **Help About** screen information.  
  
2.  Run [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] in the same registry root as was mentioned earlier, but without the **/setup** switch:  
  
     **devenv /rootsuffix Exp**  
  
3.  On  the **Help** menu, click **About Microsoft Visual Studio**.  
  
     Your VSPackage name appears in the **Installed products** list.  
  
4.  Select your VSPackage from the list.  
  
     Your VSPackage product information appears in the **Product details** text box.  
  
### To test the splash screen  
  
1.  Run devenv.exe with the **/setup** switch. To run in the experimental environment, type:  
  
     **devenv /rootsuffix Exp /setup**  
  
     **Note** You have to repeat this step only when you change the splash screen information.  
  
2.  Run [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] in the same registry root as was mentioned earlier, but with the **/splash** switch instead of the **/setup** switch.  
  
     **devenv /rootsuffix Exp /splash**  
  
     Your VSPackage product information and logo appear on the splash screen.
