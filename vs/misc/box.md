# __box
> [!NOTE]
>  This topic applies only to version 1 of Managed Extensions for C++. This syntax should only be used to maintain version 1 code. See [Boxing](/visual-cpp/windows/boxing-cpp-component-extensions) for information on using the equivalent functionality in the new syntax.  
  
 Creates a managed copy of a __value class object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
__box(  
value-class identifier  
)  
  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The `__box` keyword is used to create a managed object (derived from **System::ValueType**) from an existing __value class object. When the `__box` keyword is applied to a \__value class:  
  
-   A managed object is allocated on the common language runtime heap.  
  
-   The current value of the __value class object is bit-wise copied into the managed object.  
  
-   The address of the new managed object is returned.  
  
 This process is known as boxing. This enables any __value class object to be used in generic routines that work for any managed object because the managed object indirectly inherits from **System::Object** (since **System::ValueType** inherits from **System::Object**).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The newly created boxed object is a copy of the __value class object. Therefore, modifications to the value of the boxed object do not affect the contents of the \__value class object.  
  
## Example  
 Here's is an example that does boxing and unboxing:  
  
```  
// keyword__box.cpp  
// compile with: /clr:oldSyntax  
#using < mscorlib.dll >  
using namespace System;  
  
int main() {  
  Int32 i = 1;  
  System::Object* obj = __box(i);  
  Int32 j = *dynamic_cast<__box Int32*>(obj);  
}  
```  
  
 In the following example, an unmanaged value type (`V`) is boxed and passed as a managed parameter to the `Positive` function.  
  
```  
// keyword__box2.cpp  
// compile with: /clr:oldSyntax  
#using <mscorlib.dll>  
using namespace System;  
  
__value struct V {  
   int i;  
};  
void Positive(Object*) {}   // expects a managed class  
  
int main() {  
   V v={10};   // allocate and initialize  
   Console::WriteLine(v.i);  
  
   // copy to the common language runtime heap  
   __box V* pBoxedV = __box(v);  
   Positive(pBoxedV);   // treat as a managed class  
  
   pBoxedV->i = 20;   // update the boxed version  
   Console::WriteLine(pBoxedV->i);  
}  
```  
  
 **10**  
**20**
