# How to: Use the Animation Region of the Status Bar
The Animation region of the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] status bar displays a looping animation that indicates either a lengthy operation or an operation of indeterminate length (for example, building multiple projects in a solution).  
  
### To use the Animation region of the Visual Studio status bar  
  
1.  Obtain an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsStatusbar> interface, which is made available through the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsStatusbar> service.  
  
2.  Start the animation by calling the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsStatusbar.Animation*> method of the status bar. Pass in 1 as the value of the first parameter, and a reference to an animated icon as the value of the second parameter.  
  
3.  Stop the animation by calling the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsStatusbar.Animation*> method of the status bar. Pass in 0 as the value of the first parameter, and a reference to the animated icon as the value of the second parameter.  
  
## Example  
 This example demonstrates how to run a built-in animation in the Animation region.
