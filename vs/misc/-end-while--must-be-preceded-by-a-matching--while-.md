# &#39;End While&#39; must be preceded by a matching &#39;While&#39;
An `End While` statement occurs without a corresponding `While` statement. `End While` must be preceded by a corresponding `While` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30090  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  If this `While` block is part of a set of nested `While` blocks, make sure each block is properly terminated.  
  
2.  Verify that other control structures within the `While` block are correctly terminated.  
  
3.  Ensure that this `While` block is correctly formatted.
