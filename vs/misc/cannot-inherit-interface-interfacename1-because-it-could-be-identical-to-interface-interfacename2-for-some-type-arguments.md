# Cannot inherit interface &#39;&lt;interfacename1&gt;&#39; because it could be identical to interface &#39;&lt;interfacename2&gt;&#39; for some type arguments
A generic interface inherits more than once from another generic interface, and two of the inheritances could conflict for certain values of type arguments.  
  
 The following statements can generate this error.  
  
 `Public Interface interfaceA(Of u)`  
  
 `End Interface`  
  
 `Public Interface derivedInterface(Of t1, t2)`  
  
 `Inherits interfaceA(Of t1), interfaceA(Of t2)`  
  
 `End Interface`  
  
 If `derivedInterface` is constructed or implemented supplying the same type to both `t1` and `t2`, it must inherit two versions of `interfaceA` with identical type arguments. Doing so would produce an ambiguity about which version to access.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32120  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Change one of the type arguments supplied to the derived interface so that there is no conflict.  
  
     -or-  
  
-   Remove from the `Inherits` statement one of the interfaces causing the potential inheritance or implementation conflict.
