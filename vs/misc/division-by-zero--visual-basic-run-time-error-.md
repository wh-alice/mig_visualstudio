# Division by zero (Visual Basic Run-Time Error)
An expression being used as a divisor has a value of zero.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Check the spelling of variables in the expression. A misspelled variable name can implicitly create a numeric variable that is initialized to zero.  
  
2.  Check previous operations on variables in the expression, especially those passed into the procedure as arguments from other procedures.
