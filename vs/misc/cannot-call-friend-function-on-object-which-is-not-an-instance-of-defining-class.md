# Cannot call friend function on object which is not an instance of defining class
Either you tried to call the `Friend` procedure of a class, or you tried to access a `Friend` property or method either cross-process or cross-thread. A `Friend` procedure is callable from a module outside the class, but is part of the project in which the class is defined.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Ensure that you are calling or accessing the procedure from a module that is part of the project in which the class is defined.
