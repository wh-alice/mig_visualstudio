# VSPackages and the Managed Package Framework
You can reduce development time by creating a VSPackage with the managed package framework (MPF) classes instead of by using COM interop classes.  
  
 There are two ways to create a managed VSPackage:  
  
-   Use the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Package project template  
  
     For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Menu Command By Using the Visual Studio Package Template](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Creating%20a%20Menu%20Command%20By%20Using%20the%20Visual%20Studio%20Package%20Template.md).  
  
-   Build your VSPackage without the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Package project template  
  
     For example, you can copy a sample VSPackage and change the GUIDs and the names. You can find samples in the VSX section of [Code Gallery](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vsx/).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Managed Package Framework Classes](../misc/managed-package-framework-classes.md)
