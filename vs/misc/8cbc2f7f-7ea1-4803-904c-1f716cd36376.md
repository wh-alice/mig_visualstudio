# Unknown argument for &#39;:&#39; operator. Complete Regular Expression required in search string.
This error generally occurs during search or replace when regular expressions or wildcards are used in a search string. The operator colon (`:`) was entered but the argument that followed was not a valid argument.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Arguments for the colon (`:`) operator are case-sensitive.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Review the correct regular expression syntax located in the topic "Regular Expressions."  
  
2.  Double-check that the correct case of the argument was used.  
  
3.  If you are using an Input Method Editor (IME), make sure that the argument is not given using full-width characters.
