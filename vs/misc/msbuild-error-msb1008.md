# MSBuild Error MSB1008
**Only one project can be specified.**  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../extensibility/internals/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)] can build only one project.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Specify only one project to build. If you want to build two projects, build one project then build the other project. For example, instead of typing `msbuild myapp1.proj myapp2.proj`, build the first project by typing `msbuild myapp1.proj`, and then, when that build is complete, build the second project by typing `msbuild myapp2.proj`.
