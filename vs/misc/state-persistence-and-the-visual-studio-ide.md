# State Persistence and the Visual Studio IDE
The **Import/Export Settings** command on the **Tools** menu of the integrated development environment (IDE) imports and exports customizations of the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] environment. The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] settings APIs in the [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../extensibility/includes/vsipsdk_md.md)] enable a VSPackage to define one or more settings categories (groups of state variables) to be persisted when a user chooses the **Import/Export Settings** command.  
  
 A GUID uniquely identifies each settings category and is defined in its own registry entry, referred to as a *Custom Settings Point*.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The standard implementations of the **ToolsOptions** pages, the **Toolbox**, and the `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.DialogPage` automatically provide support for persistence. The settings API can override the default mechanism. For more information, see [Extending the Toolbox](../misc/extending-the-toolbox.md), [Options Pages](../misc/options-pages.md), and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.DialogPage>.
