# Compiler Error CS0227
Unsafe code may only appear if compiling with /unsafe  
  
 If source code contains the [unsafe](../Topic/unsafe%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md) keyword, then the [/unsafe](../Topic/-unsafe%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md) compiler option must also be used. For more information, see [Unsafe Code and Pointers](../Topic/Unsafe%20Code%20and%20Pointers%20\(C%23%20Programming%20Guide\).md).  
  
 To set the unsafe option in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../misc/includes/vs_current_long_md.md)], click on **Project** in the main menu, select the **Build** pane, and check the box that says "allow unsafe code."  
  
 The following sample, when compiled without **/unsafe**, will generate CS0227:  
  
```  
// CS0227.cs  
public class MyClass  
{  
   unsafe public static void Main()   // CS0227  
   {  
   }  
}  
```
