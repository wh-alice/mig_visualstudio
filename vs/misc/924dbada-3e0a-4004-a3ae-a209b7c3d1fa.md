# &#39;AddressOf&#39; cannot be applied to &#39;methodname&#39; because &#39;methodname&#39; is a partial method
A partial method has been passed to the `AddressOf` operator. Partial methods are invalid values for the `AddressOf` operator.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31440  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Add an implementation method for the partial method. The implementation method is a valid value for the `AddressOf` operator. The following example shows a partial method signature and its implementation.  
  
    ```vb#  
    ' Definition of the partial method signature.  
    Partial Private Sub OnNameChanged()  
        ' The body of the signature is empty.  
    End Sub  
  
    ' Implementation of the partial method.  
    Private Sub OnNameChanged()  
        MsgBox("Name was changed to " & Me.Name)  
    End Sub  
    ```
