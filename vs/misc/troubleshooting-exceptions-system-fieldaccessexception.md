# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.FieldAccessException
A <xref:System.FieldAccessException> exception is thrown when there is an invalid attempt to access a private or protected field inside a class.  
  
## Associated Tips  
 **If the access level of a field in a class library has changed, recompile any assemblies that reference that library.**  
 This exception is usually thrown when the access level (`Public`, `Private`, etc) of a field in a class library is changed, and one or more assemblies referencing the library have not been recompiled.
