# MSBuild Error MSB1027
**The /noautoresponse switch cannot be specified in the MSBuild.rsp auto-response file, nor in any response file that is referenced by the auto-response file.**  
  
 The **/noautoresponse** switch was found inside either the MSBuild.rsp file, or in another response file included by the MSBuild.rsp file. The auto-response file cannot be used to turn itself off.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Specify a different response file  
  
-   Remove the **/noautoresponse** switch from the MSBuild.rsp response file.
