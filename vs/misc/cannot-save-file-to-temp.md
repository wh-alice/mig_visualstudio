# Cannot save file to TEMP
Either a component cannot find a directory named TEMP, or the drive or partition containing the TEMP directory lacks sufficient space to save information.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Create a directory named "TEMP" and set the TEMP environment variable equal to its path.  
  
2.  Make space on the drive by erasing unnecessary files, or create a TEMP directory on another partition and set the TEMP environment variable equal to its path.
