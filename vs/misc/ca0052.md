# CA0052
No targets were selected to analyze.  
  
 There are two cases that can generate this error:  
  
-   Using the managed code analysis tool from within the IDE might cause this error if CA0001 or CA0055 were the root cause of why no targets were selected when the analysis tool was ready to analyze.  
  
-   Using FxCopCmd.exe from the command line might cause this error if it was invoked without a /f or /file switch, or with a /p or /project switch pointing to FxCop project file with no targets listed. For help on FxCopCmd.exe, type FxCopCmd /? on command line.  
  
 All other error cases should be accompanied by other messages that indicate the root cause of the error.
