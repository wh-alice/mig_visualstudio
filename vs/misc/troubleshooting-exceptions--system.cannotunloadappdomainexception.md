# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.CannotUnloadAppDomainException
A <xref:System.CannotUnloadAppDomainException> exception is thrown when there is an attempt to unload one of the following:  
  
-   The default application domain, which must remain loaded throughout the lifetime of the application  
  
-   An application domain with a running thread that cannot stop execution immediately  
  
-   An application domain that has already been unloaded  
  
## Associated Tips  
 **Make sure you are not trying to unload the application domain that is the default, has a running thread, or that has already been unloaded.**  
 Any of these conditions will cause this exception to be thrown. For more information, see <xref:System.AppDomain.Unload*>.
