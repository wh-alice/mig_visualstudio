# The folder cannot be created since a file already exists with the same path
An attempt has been made to create a directory, but a file already exists with that path. This may be a result of incorrectly parsing paths, particularly when working with relative paths.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Check that you are supplying the correct path.  
  
-   Remove the redundant file if it is no longer needed.
