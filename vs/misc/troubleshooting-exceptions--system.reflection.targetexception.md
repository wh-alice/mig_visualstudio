# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.Reflection.TargetException
The exception that is thrown when an attempt is made to invoke an invalid target.  
  
## Remarks  
 A <xref:System.Reflection.TargetException> is thrown when an attempt is made to invoke a non-static method on a null object. This may occur because the caller does not have access to the member, or because the target does not define the member, or similar circumstances.
