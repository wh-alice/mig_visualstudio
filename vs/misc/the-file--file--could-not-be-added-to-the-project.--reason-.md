# The file &#39;file&#39; could not be added to the project. &lt;reason&gt;
A file that has been read from the .vbproj or .csproj file cannot be added to the project. Reasons include:  
  
-   Invalid file name.  
  
-   File within a path. For example, if you have a project-relative path of File1\File2.txt, but there is also a folder with relative path File1\File2.txt.  
  
-   Item already exists. This occurs when a file is listed twice in the project file.  
  
-   Link already exists. The [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../data-tools/includes/csprcs_md.md)] project system has a limitation in that there can only be one link with the same name per project. This means, for example, that you cannot have a link to file.vb in both folder A and folder B of the project.  
  
 This error is most likely caused by editing the project file by hand.  
  
 Any file for which this diagnostic is displayed will not be added to the project.
