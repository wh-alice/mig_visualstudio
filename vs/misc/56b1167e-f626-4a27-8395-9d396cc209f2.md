# Cannot inherit interface &#39;&lt;interfacename1&gt;&#39; because the interface &#39;&lt;interfacename2&gt;&#39; from which it inherits could be identical to interface &#39;&lt;interfacename3&gt;&#39; for some type arguments
A generic interface inherits from two or more generic interfaces, and two of the inheritances could conflict for certain values of type arguments.  
  
 The following statements can generate this error.  
  
```  
Public Interface interfaceA(Of u)  
    Inherits interfaceX(Of u)  
End Interface  
Public Interface interfaceX(Of v)  
End Interface  
Public Interface derivedInterface(Of t1, t2)  
    Inherits interfaceA(Of t1), interfaceX(Of t2)  
End Interface  
```  
  
 If `derivedInterface` is constructed or implemented supplying the same type to both `t1` and `t2`, it must inherit two versions of `interfaceX` with identical type arguments. Doing so would produce an ambiguity about which version to access.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32121  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Change one of the type arguments supplied to the derived interface so that there is no conflict.  
  
     -or-  
  
-   Remove from the `Inherits` statement one of the interfaces causing the potential inheritance or implementation conflict.
