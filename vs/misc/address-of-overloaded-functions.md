# Address of Overloaded Functions
Use of a function name without arguments returns the address of that function. For example:  
  
```  
int Func( int i, int j );  
int Func( long l );  
  
...  
  
int (*pFunc) ( int, int ) = Func;  
```  
  
 In the preceding example, the first version of `Func` is selected, and its address is copied into `pFunc`.  
  
 The compiler determines which version of the function to select by finding a function with an argument list that exactly matches that of the target. The arguments in the overloaded function declarations are matched against one of the following:  
  
-   An object being initialized (as shown in the preceding example)  
  
-   The left side of an assignment statement  
  
-   A formal argument to a function  
  
-   A formal argument to a user-defined operator  
  
-   A function return type  
  
 If no exact match is found, the expression that takes the address of the function is ambiguous and an error is generated.  
  
 Note that although a nonmember function, `Func`, was used in the preceding example, the same rules are applied when taking the address of overloaded member functions.
