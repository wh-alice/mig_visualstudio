# Compiler Error CS0261
Partial declarations of 'type' must be all classes, all structs, or all interfaces  
  
 This error occurs if a partial type is declared as a different type of construct in various places. For more information, see [Partial Classes and Methods](../Topic/Partial%20Classes%20and%20Methods%20\(C%23%20Programming%20Guide\).md).  
  
 The following sample generates CS0261:  
  
```  
// CS0261.cs  
partial class A  // CS0261 â€“ A declared as a class here, but as a struct below  
{  
}  
  
partial struct A  
{  
}  
```
