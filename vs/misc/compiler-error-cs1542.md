# Compiler Error CS1542
'dll' cannot be added to this assembly because it already is an assembly; use '/R' option instead  
  
 The file that was referenced with the [/addmodule](../Topic/-addmodule%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md) compiler option was not built with [/target:module](../Topic/-target:module%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md); use [/reference](../Topic/-reference%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md) to reference the file in this compilation.
