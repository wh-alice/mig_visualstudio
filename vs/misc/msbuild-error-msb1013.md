# MSBuild Error MSB1013
**The response file was specified twice. A response file can be specified only once.**  
  
 The command line contains references to more than one response file. For example, `msbuild @response.rsp @response.rsp`.  
  
 This error can also occur if the specified response file includes a reference to another response file that includes a reference to the original response file. A response file can be specified only once for each compilation.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the duplicate reference to the response file. For example, instead of using `msbuild @response.rsp @response.rsp`, use `msbuild @response.rsp`.  
  
-   Remove the reference to the original response file from the response file that it references.
