# Unable to write the output of custom tool &#39;tool&#39; to file &#39;file&#39;. &lt;reason&gt;
The project system could not write the output of the custom tool to the specified file.  
  
 Provided that the file name of a custom tool's input remains unchanged, the output from a custom tool is written to the same file. This error occurs if the generated output is locked on disk.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Restart [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and rerun the custom tool by right-clicking the affected file and selecting **Run Custom Tool** from the shortcut menu.  
  
     The generated file is probably out-of-date, because the project system could not update it.
