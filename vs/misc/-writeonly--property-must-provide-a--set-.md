# &#39;WriteOnly&#39; property must provide a &#39;Set&#39;
If a property is declared as `WriteOnly`, it must supply a procedure for writing its value.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30125  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure you include a `Set` procedure between the `Property` statement and the `End Property` statement.  
  
2.  Verify that other procedures within the `Property` declaration are correctly terminated.
