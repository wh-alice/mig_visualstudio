# Could not complete operation since target directory is under source directory
A cyclic operation has failed. Cyclic operations cycle and therefore cannot complete. For example, Object A may attempt to inherit from Object B, which in turn inherits from Object A.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   When inheriting, make sure that there are no cyclic references.
