# The folder &#39;folder&#39; could not be added to the project. &lt;reason&gt;
A folder read from the .vbproj or .csproj file cannot be added to the project. Reasons include:  
  
-   Invalid name  
  
-   File within a path. For example, if you have a project-relative path of Folder1\Folder2\Folder3, but there is also a file with relative path Folder1\Folder2.  
  
-   Item already exists. This occurs when a folder is listed twice in the project file.  
  
 This error is most likely caused by editing the project file by hand.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Remove the affected folder node from the project file.  
  
     Any folder, and any files below the folder, for which this diagnostic is displayed will not be added to the project.
