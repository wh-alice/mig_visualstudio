# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.ServiceModel.ServiceActivationException
A <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceActivationException> exception is thrown when a service fails to activate.  
  
## Remarks  
 This exception derives from <xref:System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException>, which represents a class of recoverable errors that may be thrown during communication between endpoints, and which [!INCLUDE[vsindigo](../data-tools/includes/vsindigo_md.md)] robust client and service applications are expected to handle. To prevent the more generic <xref:System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException> handler from catching the more specific <xref:System.ServiceModel.ActionNotSupportedException>, catch this exception prior to handling <xref:System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException>.
