# &#39;ReadOnly&#39; variable cannot be the target of an assignment
A `ReadOnly` property has been found in a context that assigns a value to it. Only writable variables, properties, and array elements can have values assigned to them during execution.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30064  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the `ReadOnly` keyword from the `Dim` statement declaring the variable, or remove the statement that assigns it a value.
