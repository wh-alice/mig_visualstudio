# Command &lt;name&gt; is not valid.
This error generally occurs when a command or alias of a command not recognized by Visual Studio has been entered into the **Find/Command**box or the **Command** window. If an alias has been entered, the full command name appears instead of the alias name in the error message.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Re-enter the command name or choose a valid command name.
