# Compiler Error CS0077
The as operator must be used with a reference type or nullable type ('int' is a non-nullable value type).  
  
 The [as](../Topic/as%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md) operator was passed a [value type](../Topic/Value%20Types%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md). Because `as` can return [null](../Topic/null%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md), it can only be passed [reference types](../Topic/Reference%20Types%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md) or nullable type. For more information about nullable types, see [Nullable Types](../Topic/Nullable%20Types%20\(C%23%20Programming%20Guide\).md).  
  
 The following sample generates CS0077:  
  
```  
// CS0077.cs  
using System;  
  
class C  
{  
}  
  
struct S  
{  
}  
  
class M  
{  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
      object o1, o2;  
      C c;  
      S s;  
  
      o1 = new C();  
      o2 = new S();  
  
      s = o2 as S;  // CS0077, S is not a reference type.  
      // try the following line instead  
      // c = o1 as C;  
   }  
}  
```
