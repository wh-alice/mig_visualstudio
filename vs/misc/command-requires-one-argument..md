# Command requires one argument.
This error generally occurs when not enough information has been entered for the command or because an incorrect combination of arguments was used.  
  
 For example, if `alias` `/delete sample1 sample2` has been entered for the `alias` command, this error will appear because alias `/delete` can only take one alias name, not two. Alias names do not contain spaces, so the **Find/Command** box and **Command** window interpret `sample1 sample2` as two different alias names.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Check the documentation for the correct syntax for the command and try again.
