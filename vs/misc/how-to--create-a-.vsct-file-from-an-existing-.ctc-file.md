# How to: Create a .Vsct File from an Existing .Ctc File
You can create an XML-based .vsct file from an existing command table .ctc source file. By doing this, you can take advantage of the new XML-based [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] command table (VSCT) compiler format.  
  
### To create a .vsct file from a .ctc file  
  
1.  Obtain a copy of the Perl language.  
  
2.  Obtain a copy of the Perl script ConvertCTCToVSCT.pl, typically located in the *\<Visual Studio SDK installation path>*\VisualStudioIntegration\Tools\bin folder.  
  
3.  Obtain a copy of the .ctc source file that you want to convert.  
  
4.  Place the files in the same directory.  
  
5.  In the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Command Prompt window, navigate to the directory.  
  
6.  Type  
  
    ```  
    perl.exe ConvertCTCtoVSCT.pl PkgCmd.ctc PkgCmd.vsct  
    ```  
  
     where PkgCmd.ctc is the name of the .ctc file and PkgCmd.vsct is the name of the .vsct file that you want to create.  
  
     This creates a new .vsct XML command table source file. You can compile the file by using Vsct.exe, the VSCT compiler, as you would any other .vsct file.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can improve the readability of the .vsct file by reformatting the XML comments.
