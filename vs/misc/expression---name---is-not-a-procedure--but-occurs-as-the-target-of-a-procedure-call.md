# Expression &#39;&lt;name&gt;&#39; is not a procedure, but occurs as the target of a procedure call
You have made a procedure call to an expression that is not a procedure.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure you did not misspell the name of the procedure.  
  
2.  Supply the procedure that <`name`> calls.
