# How to: Force a VSPackage to Load
VSPackages are ordinarily loaded only when their accompanying functionality is required to complete a process. Under some circumstances, however, a VSPackage may have to force another VSPackage to be loaded. For example, a lightweight VSPackage might load a larger VSPackage in a programming context that is not available as a CMDUIContext.  
  
 You can use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsShell.LoadPackage*> method to force a VSPackage to load.  
  
### To force a VSPackage to load  
  
-   Insert this code into the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package.Initialize*> method of the VSPackage that forces another VSPackage to load:  
  
     [!code[ForceVSPackageLoad#01](../misc/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to--force-a-vspackage-to-load_1.cs)]  
  
     When the VSPackage is initialized, it will force `PackageToBeLoaded` to load.  
  
## Robust Programming  
 Force loading should not be used for VSPackage communication. Use [Using and Providing Services](../extensibility/using-and-providing-services.md) instead.
