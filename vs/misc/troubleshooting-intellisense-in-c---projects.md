# Troubleshooting IntelliSense in C++ Projects
IntelliSense can stop working under certain conditions. Use the following steps to help determine why IntelliSense does not work for C++ projects.  
  
### To investigate IntelliSense failure in C++ projects  
  
1.  Make sure that the Visual C++ project contains no compilation errors.  
  
    1.  If the project is a Makefile project, see [How to: Enable IntelliSense for Makefile Projects](../Topic/How%20to:%20Enable%20IntelliSense%20for%20Makefile%20Projects.md).  
  
2.  Make sure that stdafx.h is on the include path. For more information about include paths in Visual C++ projects, see [#include Directive (C/C++)](../Topic/%23include%20Directive%20\(C-C++\).md) and [/I (Additional Include Directories)](../Topic/-I%20\(Additional%20Include%20Directories\).md).  
  
## IntelliSense Limitations  
 IntelliSense does not work in C++ projects under the following circumstances:  
  
-   The cursor is in a code comment.  
  
-   You are writing a string literal.  
  
-   A syntax error appears over the cursor.  
  
-   The solution consists of either the syntax for managed C++, or the earlier Managed Extensions for C++ syntax.  
  
-   IntelliSense is not fully supported when you reference a header file multiple times by using the `#include` directive, and the meaning of that header file changes because of various macro states that are defined through the `#define` directive. In other words, when you include a header file several times and the header usage changes under different macro states, IntelliSense does not always work.
