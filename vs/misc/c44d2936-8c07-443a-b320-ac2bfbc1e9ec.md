# &#39;IsNot&#39; requires operands that have reference types, but this operand has the value type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39;.
An expression uses the [IsNot Operator](../Topic/IsNot%20Operator%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md) with at least one value type operand.  
  
 The `IsNot` operator determines whether two object references refer to different objects. It compares the pointer values of reference types and is meaningless with value types.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31419  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   If you intend to compare the values of two value types, use the `=` or `<>` comparison operator.  
  
-   If you intend to compare the pointers of two reference types, be sure you are using object references for both operands. You can use reference variables or elements, such as the [Me](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a65973c7-cf06-4547-9b25-9fba885525c2) keyword, that behave like reference variables.
