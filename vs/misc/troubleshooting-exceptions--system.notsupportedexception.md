# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.NotSupportedException
A <xref:System.NotSupportedException> exception is thrown when an invoked method is not supported, or when there is an attempt to read, seek, or write to a stream that does not support the invoked functionality.  
  
## Associated Tips  
 **Check to make sure the method is supported.**  
 There are methods that are not supported in the base class, with the expectation that these methods will be supported in the derived classes instead. If a derived class implements only a subset of the methods from its base class, it will throw a <xref:System.NotSupportedException> exception for the unsupported methods.  
  
## Remarks  
 When working with the [!INCLUDE[Compact](../extensibility/includes/compact_md.md)] and using P/Invoke on a native function, this exception may be thrown if:  
  
-   The declaration in managed code is incorrect.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[Compact](../extensibility/includes/compact_md.md)] does not support what you are trying to do.  
  
-   The DLL names are mangled on export.  
  
-   In such a case, check:  
  
-   For any violations of the [!INCLUDE[Compact](../extensibility/includes/compact_md.md)] P/Invoke restrictions.  
  
-   For any arguments that require pre-allocated memory. If these exist, you should pass a reference to an existing variable.  
  
-   That the names of the exported functions are correct. This can be verified with DumpBin.exe.  
  
-   That you are not attempting to pass too many arguments.
