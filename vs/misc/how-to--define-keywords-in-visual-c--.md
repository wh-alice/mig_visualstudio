# How to: Define Keywords in Visual C++
Keywords are predefined, reserved identifiers that have special meanings. They cannot be used as identifiers in a program. However, you can define your own keywords to use in Visual C++, and you can assign customized syntax coloring to the keywords. Syntax coloring gives you visual cues about the structure and state of your code.  
  
### To define your own Visual C++ keywords  
  
1.  Use the Visual Studio [Code and Text Editor](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/508e1f18-99d5-48ad-b5ad-d011b21c6ab1) or Notepad.exe to create a text-only file named `usertype.dat`.  
  
2.  In `usertype.dat`, type each user-defined keyword on a separate line.  
  
3.  Save `usertype.dat`in the directory that contains devenv.exe. By default, the path of that directory is *\<drive>*:\Program Files\\[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu](../misc/includes/tlasharptla_visualstu_md.md)] *\<major.minor version number>*\Common7\\[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ide](../misc/includes/tla2sharptla_ide_md.md)]. Because that directory is read-only by default, you need administrative credentials to save `usertype.dat`.  
  
4.  Exit Visual Studio, and then restart it.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You cannot rename or reload the `usertype.dat` file during an editing session because it is read during initialization. All previously defined color settings take precedence because the syntax coloring mechanism checks the `usertype.dat` file last.  
  
5.  On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**. In the **Options** dialog box, click **Environment**, then click **Fonts and Colors**, and then in the **Display items:** list, click **C/C++ User Keywords**.  
  
6.  Set the font and color properties of your user-defined keywords as described in [Fonts and Colors, Environment, Options Dialog Box](../ide-reference/fonts-and-colors--environment--options-dialog-box.md).
