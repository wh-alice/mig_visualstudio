# Hiding Properties That Have Child Properties
You would want to hide properties that have child properties:  
  
-   If you have nested projects where the parent project programmatically controls some aspects of the child project.  
  
-   If you use a control with a specialized designer and you do not want to give developers full access to all the properties of the control.  
  
-   If you have scope ownership of an object and want to limit the view of properties.  
  
### To hide properties that have child properties  
  
1.  Set the `pfDisplay` parameter in <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPerPropertyBrowsing.DisplayChildProperties%2A> to `FALSE`.  
  
2.  Set the `pfHide` parameter in <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPerPropertyBrowsing.HideProperty%2A> to `TRUE`.
