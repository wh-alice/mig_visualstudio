# MSBuild Error MSB3254
**MSB3254: The file \<name> will be ignored because it cannot be read. This file was either passed in to InstalledAssemblySubsetTables or was found by searching the \<name> folder in the TargetFrameworkDirectories.**  
  
 This error occurs when the [!INCLUDE[net_client_v35_long](../misc/includes/net_client_v35_long_md.md)] XML file, client.xml, cannot be read. The file is unreadable because of corruption, locking, or some other problem.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[net_client_v35_long](../misc/includes/net_client_v35_long_md.md)] is a subset of the full [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] 3.5 run-time library. For more information about the [!INCLUDE[net_client_v35_long](../misc/includes/net_client_v35_long_md.md)], see [.NET Framework Client Profile](../Topic/.NET%20Framework%20Client%20Profile.md).  
  
 Procedures  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Ensure that you have full permissions and full access to the file, or reinstall the [!INCLUDE[net_client_v35_long](../misc/includes/net_client_v35_long_md.md)] redistributable run-time library to replace the corrupted file.
