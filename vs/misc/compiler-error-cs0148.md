# Compiler Error CS0148
The delegate 'delegate' does not have a valid constructor  
  
 You imported and used a managed program (one that uses the .NET Framework common language runtime) that was created with another compiler. That compiler allowed an ill-formed [delegate](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/delegate) constructor. For more information, see [Delegates](/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/index).
