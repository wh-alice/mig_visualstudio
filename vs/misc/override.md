# override
The `override` keyword has essentially the same meaning and syntax in both ISO C++ and in C++ Component Extensions (C++/CLI and C++/CX). However, there are some differences in the implications of its use. For details, see these articles:  
  
 For ISO C++:  
  
-   ISO C++ [override](../misc/override.md)  
  
-   ISO C++ [Explicit Overrides (C++)](/visual-cpp/cpp/explicit-overrides-cpp)  
  
-   (Windows Store apps) [Ref classes and structs (C++/CX)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/3d736b82-0bf0-48cf-bac1-cc9d110b70d1)
