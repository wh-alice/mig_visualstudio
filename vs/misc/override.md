# override
The `override` keyword has essentially the same meaning and syntax in both ISO C++ and in C++ Component Extensions (C++/CLI and C++/CX). However, there are some differences in the implications of its use. For details, see these articles:  
  
 For ISO C++:  
  
-   ISO C++ [override](../misc/override.md)  
  
-   ISO C++ [Explicit Overrides (C++)](../Topic/Explicit%20Overrides%20\(C++\).md)  
  
-   (Windows Store apps) [Ref classes and structs (C++/CX)](../Topic/Ref%20classes%20and%20structs%20\(C++-CX\).md)  
  
-   [override](../Topic/override%20%20\(C++%20Component%20Extensions\).md)  
  
-   [Explicit Overrides  (C++ Component Extensions)](../Topic/Explicit%20Overrides%20%20\(C++%20Component%20Extensions\).md)
