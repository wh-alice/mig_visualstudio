# Cannot copy multifile assembly &#39;assembly&#39; to directory &#39;directory&#39;. &lt;reason&gt;
Multifile assemblies are copied to a subdirectory of the project directory from which they will be run. For example, if the output path is c:\project1\bin, and there exists an assembly (whose `CopyLocal` property is `true`) named Test containing files a.dll and b.dll, you will have the following file structure after the copy is complete:  
  
```  
c:\project1\bin\Test  
   c:\project1\bin\Test\Test.dll   (main assembly)  
   c:\project1\bin\Test\a.dll       (file a.dll)  
   c:\project1\bin\Test\b.dll       (file b.dll)  
```  
  
 This error would be displayed by the project system if the directory c:\project1\bin\Test could not be created on disk.  
  
 This error indicates that you are out of disk space or are hitting the MAX_PATH limit for path lengths.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Check for disk space.  
  
-   Move the project to a folder whose path length is less than the path length of the folder the project is currently in.  
  
-   Change the output directory to a folder with a shorter absolute path length (applicable for client projects only).
