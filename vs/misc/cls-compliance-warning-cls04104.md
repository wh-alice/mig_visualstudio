# CLS Compliance Warning CLS04104
Attributes shall be of type 'System::Attribute', or inherit from it  
  
 In order to be CLS compliant, a custom attribute must inherit from System::Attribute.  An attribute that did not inherit from System::Attribute was applied to a member function.  
  
 The following declaration (using MSIL assembly language) shows what could cause CLS04111:  
  
```  
.class public auto ansi MyAttribute  
       extends [mscorlib]System.Object  
```  
  
 and then a member function that uses the attribute:  
  
```  
.custom instance void MyAttribute::.ctor(int32) = ( 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 )  
```  
  
 Causing the attribute to derive from System::Attribute resolves the warning:  
  
```  
.class public auto ansi MyAttribute  
       extends [mscorlib]System.Attribute  
```
