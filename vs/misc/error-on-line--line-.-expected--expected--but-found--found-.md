# Error on line &lt;line&gt;. Expected &#39;expected&#39; but found &#39;found&#39;
This is a general XML parsing error when reading the project file. This error can occur for project files (.vbproj/.csproj) as well as per-user settings files (.vbproj.user/.csproj.user). More information will be provided by the project system in the parameters `expected` and `found`.  
  
 This error is most likely caused by editing the project (or user) file by hand.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Edit the project file again and restore it to a satisfactory condition.
