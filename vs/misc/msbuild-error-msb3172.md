# MSBuild Error MSB3172
**MSB3172: Unable to read manifest '\<file>'. '\<error>'**  
  
 This error is generated when the build process encounters a general problem reading a manifest file. The error message contains the file name followed by more detailed information about what went wrong.  
  
 You might have added an assembly or a manifest file as a content file. You should use the **Add Reference** command instead of **Add File** so that the dependent assembly is properly referenced by the project system. More sophisticated projects commonly mark the .exe.manifest in the bin folder as a project file, but you should avoid doing so. The hidden app.manifest file becomes the .exe.manifest file and can be edited manually for advanced scenarios.
