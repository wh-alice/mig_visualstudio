 This error might also be caused by antivirus software blocking some devenv.exe processes. Several features in the product use scripts, and these scripts might be blocked by antivirus software. For related information, see "PRB: Visual IDE does not open when started or application cannot start error message" online at [http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;306905&Product=vsnet](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;306905&Product=vsnet).
