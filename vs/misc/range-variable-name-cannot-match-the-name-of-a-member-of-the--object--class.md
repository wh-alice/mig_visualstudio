# Range variable name cannot match the name of a member of the &#39;Object&#39; class
A range variable in a LINQ query matches the name of a member of the <xref:System.Object> class. This creates a conflict with the objects created by Visual Basic for the LINQ query.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36606  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Choose a new name for the range variable that does not match the name of any member of the <xref:System.Object> class.
