# Option is not currently valid.
This error generally occurs when an argument or switch for a command has been specified that is not currently available. For example, if you entered `>Edit.Find test /sel` and no selection has been made in the file, the /sel switch would not be available.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Verify that the arguments and switches entered are currently available. For more information, see [Visual Studio Commands with Arguments](../reference/visual-studio-commands.md).
