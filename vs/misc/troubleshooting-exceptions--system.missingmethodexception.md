# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.MissingMethodException
A <xref:System.MissingMethodException> exception is thrown when there is an attempt to dynamically access a method that does not exist.  
  
## Associated Tips  
 **If a method in a class library has been removed or renamed, recompile any assemblies that reference that method.**  
 This exception is typically thrown when an attempt is made to dynamically access a deleted or renamed method of an assembly that is not referenced by its strong name.  
  
## Remarks  
 If you are calling an unmanaged function, this exception is thrown if the CLR cannot find the module or function.
