# Compiler Error CS0200
Property or indexer 'property' cannot be assigned to â€” it is read only  
  
 An attempt was made to assign a value to a [property](../Topic/Using%20Properties%20\(C%23%20Programming%20Guide\).md), but the property does not have a set accessor. Resolve the error by adding a set accessor. For more information, see [How to: Declare and Use Read Write Properties](../Topic/How%20to:%20Declare%20and%20Use%20Read%20Write%20Properties%20\(C%23%20Programming%20Guide\).md).  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS0200:  
  
```  
// CS0200.cs  
public class MainClass  
{  
    // private int _mi;  
    int I  
    {  
        get  
        {  
            return 1;  
        }  
  
        // uncomment the set accessor and declaration for _mi  
        /*  
        set  
        {  
            _mi = value;  
        }  
        */  
    }  
  
    public static void Main ()  
    {  
        MainClass II = new MainClass();  
        II.I = 9;   // CS0200  
    }  
}  
```
