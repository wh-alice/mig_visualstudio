# Configuration name is not valid.
This error generally occurs when the name entered for the build configuration includes illegal characters, such as \<, >, &#124;, and *.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Check that the configuration name does not contain the following characters: \<, >, *, &#124;, :, \\, /, &, %, ", ., #, ?, or a leading or trailing space. In addition, the configuration name cannot use names reserved for Windows or DOS, such as "nul", "aux", "con', "com#", "lpt#", and so on.  
  
2.  Re-type the name.
