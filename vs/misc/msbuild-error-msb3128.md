# MSBuild Error MSB3128
**MSB3128: The ClickOnce manifests cannot be signed because they contain one or more references that are not hashed.**  
  
 When you publish an application that has a signed manifest, all files must be included in the hash.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Go to the **Publish** page of the **Project Designer**.  
  
2.  Click **Application Files**.  
  
3.  Set the **Hash** value to **Include** for all files that are to be published.
