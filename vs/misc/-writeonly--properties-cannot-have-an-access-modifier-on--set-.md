# &#39;WriteOnly&#39; properties cannot have an access modifier on &#39;Set&#39;
A `WriteOnly` property declaration specifies access levels in both the [Property Statement](../Topic/Property%20Statement.md) and the [Set Statement](../Topic/Set%20Statement%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md).  
  
 You can always specify an access level for the property. In addition, you can specify a different access level for at most one of its property procedures (`Get` or `Set`), provided it is more restrictive than the property's access level. You cannot specify access levels for both of the property procedures.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31104  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the access modifier from the `Set` statement. It represents the entire `WriteOnly` property, and you cannot have two access levels for the property.
