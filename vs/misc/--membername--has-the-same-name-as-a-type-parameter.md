# &#39;&lt;membername&gt; has the same name as a type parameter
A member of a generic class or structure has the same name as a type parameter of that class or structure.  
  
 Every variable, constant, enumeration, procedure, property, event, and delegate must have a name distinct from every type parameter.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32054  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Change the name of the class or structure member so that it is different from every type parameter name.
