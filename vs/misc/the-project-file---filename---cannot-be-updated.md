# The project file &#39;&lt;filename&gt;&#39; cannot be updated
You are attempting to open a project created in an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. The project must be updated to the current format, but it cannot be updated because either the specified project file (.vbproj) is marked as read-only or the file is under source control and is currently locked by another user.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  In File Explorer, locate the specified project file.  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, choose **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **Properties** dialog box, uncheck the **Read-only** attribute.  
  
 If the file is under source code control and is locked by another user, wait until the file is available and check it out locally.
