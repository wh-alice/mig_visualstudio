# MSBuild Error MSB2008
**The Visual Studio project system cannot convert "{0}" projects. It can only be used to convert C# and VB client projects.**  
  
 Only valid [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../codequality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../datatools/includes/csprcs_md.md)] projects can be converted using [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../extensibility/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)].  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   If the project is a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../codequality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../datatools/includes/csprcs_md.md)] project, check whether the project file has been modified or corrupted. If it has been modified or corrupted, open the project in the version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] in which it was created, save it, and then attempt to convert it again.  
  
-   If the project is not a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../codequality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../datatools/includes/csprcs_md.md)] project, use the appropriate tool to convert it.
