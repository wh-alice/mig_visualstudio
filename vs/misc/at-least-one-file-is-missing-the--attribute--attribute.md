# At least one file is missing the &#39;attribute&#39; attribute
A file node that has been read from the .vbproj or .csproj file is missing certain attributes that the project system requires. Currently the only such attribute is the `RelPath` attribute, which specifies where under the project folder the file is located.  
  
 This error is most likely caused by editing the project file by hand.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Remove the affected file node from the project file. Also, if the file is still on disk, you could switch to show **Show All Files** mode (by clicking that button in the Solution Explorer toolbar), right-click the affected file, and select **Include In Project**.  
  
     Any file for which the `RelPath` attribute is missing will not be added to the project.
