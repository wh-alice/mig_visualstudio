# &#39;MustOverride&#39; method &#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; cannot be called with &#39;MyClass&#39;
`MyClass` is equivalent to `Me`, but all method invocations on it are treated as if the method being invoked were `NotOverridable`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30614  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the `MustOverride` modifier, or declare the method in a base class and inherit and override that class.
