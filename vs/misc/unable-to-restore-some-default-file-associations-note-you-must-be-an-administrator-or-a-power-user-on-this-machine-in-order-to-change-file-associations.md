# Unable to restore some default file associations. Note: you must be an administrator or a power user on this machine in order to change file associations.
This error occurs when the devenv command-line switch /AssociateFiles is used, but the current user rights do not allow access to the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT section of the registry. When you run [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] on [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../debugger/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)], you must run devenv as an administrator to use the /AssociateFiles (devenv.exe) switch.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Change to administrative credentials and try again.
