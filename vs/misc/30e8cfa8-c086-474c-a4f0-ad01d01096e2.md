# Return and parameter types of &#39;&lt;operator&gt;&#39; must be &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; to be used in a &#39;For&#39; statement
A `For` loop specifies a counter variable of a type that does not define the `+` or `-` operator with parameters and return value of its own type.  
  
 The counter variable must be of a type that supports addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`) operators that operate completely on their containing type. This means both of the operands and the return value must be of the type of the counter variable.  
  
 If you use a numeric data type for the counter variable, the `+` and `-` operators are supported on the containing type. If you use a user-defined class or structure, you must define both operators with operands and return value of the type of your class or structure.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33039  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure the spelling of the counter-variable data type is correct.  
  
2.  If you are using a user-defined class or structure for the counter variable, define `+` and `-` operators that operate completely on that class or structure.
