# &#39;&lt;classname&gt;&#39; is not CLS-compliant because it derives from &#39;&lt;baseclassname&gt;&#39;, which is not CLS-compliant
A class or interface is marked as `<CLSCompliant(True)>` when it derives from or implements a type that is marked as `<CLSCompliant(False)>` or is not marked.  
  
 For a class or interface to be compliant with the [Language Independence and Language-Independent Components](../Topic/Language%20Independence%20and%20Language-Independent%20Components.md) (CLS), its entire inheritance hierarchy must be compliant. That means every type from which it inherits, directly or indirectly, must be compliant. Similarly, if a class implements one or more interfaces, they must all be compliant throughout their inheritance hierarchies.  
  
 When you apply the \<xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  
  
 If you do not apply the \<xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](../ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40026  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   If you require CLS compliance, define this type within a different inheritance hierarchy or implementation scheme.  
  
-   If you require that this type remain within its current inheritance hierarchy or implementation scheme, remove the \<xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> from its definition or mark it as `<CLSCompliant(False)>`.
