|Title|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[operator new](/visual-cpp/c-runtime-library/operator-new-crt)|Allocates a block of memory from the heap.|  
|[operator new](../Topic/operator%20new%20\(%3Cnew%3E\).md)|The function that's called by a new-expression to allocate storage for individual objects.|  
|[new Operator](/visual-cpp/cpp/new-operator-cpp)|Allocates memory for an object or array of objects from the free store and returns a suitably typed, nonzero pointer to the object.|  
|[new (new slot in vtable)](/visual-cpp/windows/new-new-slot-in-vtable-cpp-component-extensions)|In a C++/CLI project, indicates that a virtual member gets a new slot in the vtable. In other words, the function does not override a base class method.|  
|[ref new, gcnew](/visual-cpp/windows/ref-new-gcnew-cpp-component-extensions)|In a [!INCLUDE[cppwrt_short](../misc/includes/cppwrt_short_md.md)] (`ref new`) or C++/CLI (`gcnew`) project, this compound keyword creates a reference-counted object.|
