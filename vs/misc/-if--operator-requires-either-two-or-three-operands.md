# &#39;If&#39; operator requires either two or three operands
The `If` operator accepts only two or three arguments.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33104  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Examine the `If` expression to see whether the number of operators can be reduced or extended to either two or three arguments.  
  
-   Consider using another conditional construction, such as an `If...Then...Else` statement or a nested `If...Then...Else` statement to organize the arguments.
