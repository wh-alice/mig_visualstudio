# Overflow.
An assignment exceeded the limitations of the target of the assignment. This error generally occurs when one of the following is true:  
  
-   The result of an assignment, calculation, or data type conversion is too large to be represented within the range of values allowed for that type of variable.  
  
-   An assignment to a property exceeds the maximum value the property can accept.  
  
-   You attempt to use a number in a calculation, and that number is converted into an integer, but the result is larger than an integer.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Assign the value to a variable of a type that can hold a larger range of values.  
  
     —or—  
  
     Make sure your assignment fits the range for the property to which it is made.
