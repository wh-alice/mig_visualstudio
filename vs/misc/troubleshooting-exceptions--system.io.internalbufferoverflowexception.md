# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.IO.InternalBufferOverflowException
An <xref:System.IO.InternalBufferOverflowException> exception is thrown when the internal buffer overflows.  
  
## Associated Tips  
 **When using FileSystemWatcher, filter out unwanted change notifications.**  
 In a file-system watcher, when you are notified of file changes, the system stores those changes in a buffer that the component creates and passes to the application programming interfaces (APIs). If there are many changes in a short time, the buffer can overflow, resulting in an <xref:System.IO.InternalBufferOverflowException> exception, which loses all changes. To keep the buffer from overflowing, use the <xref:System.IO.FileSystemWatcher.NotifyFilter*> and <xref:System.IO.FileSystemWatcher.IncludeSubdirectories*> properties to filter out unwanted change notifications. For more information, see <xref:System.IO.FileSystemWatcher>.  
  
## Remarks  
 You can also increase the size of the internal buffer through the <xref:System.IO.FileSystemWatcher.InternalBufferSize*> property. However, increasing the size of the buffer will affect performance, so it is best to keep the buffer as small as possible.
