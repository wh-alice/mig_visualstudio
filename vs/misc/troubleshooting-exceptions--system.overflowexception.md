# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.OverflowException
An <xref:System.OverflowException> exception is thrown when an arithmetic, casting, or conversion operation in a checked context results in an overflow. An overflow occurs when an operation produces a value too large for the destination type, infinity, or Not a Number (NaN).  
  
## Associated Tips  
 **When casting from a number, the value must be a valid number less than infinity.**  
 A source value cannot be infinity or Not a Number.  
  
 **Make sure you are not dividing by zero.**  
 Dividing by zero will typically yield this exception.  
  
## Remarks  
 In languages that detect overflow, <xref:System.OverflowException> is the exception that is thrown when overflow occurs. For example, in C#, the `checked` keyword is used to detect overflow conditions. An <xref:System.OverflowException> exception occurs only in a checked context.  
  
 For a result from an integral or decimal-type arithmetic operation or conversion that is outside the range of the destination type:  
  
-   In a checked context, a compile-time error occurs if the operation is a constant expression. Otherwise, an <xref:System.OverflowException> exception is thrown if the operation is performed at run time.  
  
-   In an unchecked context, the result is truncated by discarding any high-order bits that do not fit in the destination type.  
  
 For information about the value ranges of data types, see [Data Types](../Topic/Data%20Type%20Summary%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md), [Integral Types Table](../Topic/Integral%20Types%20Table%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md), or [Floating-Point Types Table](../Topic/Floating-Point%20Types%20Table%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md).
