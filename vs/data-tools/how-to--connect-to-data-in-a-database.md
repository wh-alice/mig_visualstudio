# How to: Connect to Data in a Database
You can use Visual Studio to connect your application to a database. After creating the data connection, Visual Studio generates a data model that your application uses to interact with the data in the database. The objects in the data model appear in the [Data Sources Window](../Topic/Data%20Sources%20Window.md). You can then create data-bound controls by dragging items from the **Data Sources Window** to a design surface. For more information, see [Bind controls to data in Visual Studio](../data-tools/bind-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio.md).  
  
 This topic provides instructions for connecting to a database and creating the following types of data models:  
  
-   Dataset  
  
-   Entity Data Model (EDM)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can also use Visual Studio to create LINQ to SQL classes from a database. However, LINQ to SQL classes do not appear in the **Data Sources** window, and therefore cannot be dragged directly to a designer to create data-bound controls. For more information about creating LINQ to SQL classes from a database, see [How to: Create LINQ to SQL classes mapped to tables and views (O/R Designer)](../data-tools/how-to--create-linq-to-sql-classes-mapped-to-tables-and-views--o-r-designer-.md).

##  <a name="dataset"></a> Connecting to a Database and Creating a Dataset  
 When you create a dataset that is based on a database, Visual Studio creates a set of classes that represent a programmable view of the data. The main class is called a *typed dataset*. The typed dataset contains data table objects that represent tables in the database. For more information about typed datasets, see [Dataset tools in Visual Studio](../data-tools/dataset-tools-in-visual-studio.md).  
  
 After you create a dataset, you can create data-bound WPF or Windows Forms controls by dragging dataset objects from the Data Sources window to the WPF or Windows Forms designer.  
  
#### To connect your application to a database and create a dataset  
  
1.  Open an existing project in Visual Studio, or create a new project.  
  
2.  On the **Data** menu, click **Add New Data Source**.  
  
     The **Data Source Configuration Wizard** opens.  
  
3.  On the **Choose a Data Source Type** page, select **Database**, and then click **Next**.  
  
4.  On the **Choose a Database Model** page, select **Dataset**, and then click **Next**.  
  
5.  On the **Choose Your Data Connection** page, select a data connection from the list of available connections and then click **Next**.  
  
     If your desired data connection is not available, create a new connection by following the steps in [Creating a New Database Connection](#CreatingDataConnection).  
  
6.  On the **Save the Connection String to the Application Configure File** page, optionally clear the **Yes, save the connection as** check box if you want to save the connection string directly in the compiled application. By default, the connection is saved in the application configuration file. For more information, see [How to: Save and Edit Connection Strings](../Topic/How%20to:%20Save%20and%20Edit%20Connection%20Strings.md).  
  
7.  On the **Choose Your Database Objects** page, select the database objects that you will use in your application. You also have the option of replacing the default **DataSet name**.  
  
8.  Click **Finish**. The dataset you just created is now available in the **Data Sources** window.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If the **Data Sources** window is not open, click **Show Data Sources** on the **Data** menu to open the window.  
  
9. You can now drag items from the **Data Sources** window to the WPF designer, the Windows Forms designer, or the [Component Designer](../Topic/Component%20Designer.md) to create data-bound controls. For more information, see [Bind controls to data in Visual Studio](../data-tools/bind-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio.md).  
  
##  <a name="edm"></a> Connecting to Database and Creating an Entity Data Model  
 When you create an Entity Data Model that is based on a database, Visual Studio creates a set of classes that represent a programmable view of the data. For more information about Entity Data Models and the ADO.NET Entity Framework, see [Entity Framework Overview](../Topic/Entity%20Framework%20Overview.md).  
  
 After you create an Entity Data Model, you can create data-bound WPF controls by dragging entity objects from the Data Sources window to the WPF designer.  
  
#### To connect your application to a database and create an Entity Data Model  
  
1.  Open an existing project in Visual Studio, or create a new project.  
  
2.  Follow the steps in the **Entity Data Model Wizard** to connect to a database and specify the contents of the model. For more information, see [How to: Create a New .edmx File](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/beb8189e-e51c-4051-839c-9902c224abf2).  
  
3.  After you complete the **Entity Data Model Wizard**, the Entity Data Model you created opens in the Entity Data Model Designer, and the data objects are now available in the **Data Sources** window.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If the **Data Sources** window is not open, click **Show Data Sources** on the **Data** menu to open the window.  
  
4.  If the WPF designer is open, you can now drag items from the **Data Sources** window to the designer to create controls that are bound to the Entity Data Model. For more information, see [Bind WPF controls to data in Visual Studio](../data-tools/bind-wpf-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio2.md).  
  
     If the Windows Forms designer is open, you cannot drag items from the **Data Sources** to the designer. To create controls that are bound to the Entity Data Model, you must build the project, add a new object data source that is based on the Entity Data Model, and then drag those objects to the designer.  
  
##  <a name="CreatingDataConnection"></a> Creating a New Database Connection  
 When you use the **Data Source Configuration Wizard**or the **Entity Data Model Wizard**, you must specify a connection to the database you want to use. If you do not already have a connection to the database, perform the following steps to create the connection.  
  
 These instructions assume you have already started the **Data Source Configuration Wizard** or the **Entity Data Model Wizard** as described in [Connecting to Database and Creating a Dataset](#dataset) and [Connecting to Database and Creating an Entity Data Model](#edm).  
  
#### To create a new database connection  
  
1.  On the **Choose Your Data Connection** page of the **Data Source Configuration Wizard** or the **Entity Data Model Wizard**, click **New Connection**.  
  
     One of the following actions occur:  
  
    -   If you have already created a data connection in Visual Studio, the **Add Connection** dialog box opens.  
  
    -   If this is the first data connection you have created in Visual Studio, the **Choose Data Source** dialog box displays. Select the type of database you want to connect to, and then click **OK** to display the **Add Connection** dialog box.  
  
2.  In the **Add Connection** dialog box, enter the requested information. The **Add Connection** dialog box is different for each type of data provider.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If the selected **Data source** in the **Add Connection** dialog box is not the data source you want to connect to, click **Change** to open the **Change Data Source** dialog box and then choose a different data source.  
  
3.  In the **Add Connection** dialog box, click **OK**.  
  
     You return to the **Choose Your Data Connection** page of the **Data Source Configuration Wizard** or the **Entity Data Model Wizard**.  
  
4.  On the **Choose Your Data Connection** page, make sure that the new data connection is selected and then click **Next**.  
  
5.  Complete the remaining steps in the **Data Source Configuration Wizard** or the **Entity Data Model Wizard**.  
  
## .NET Framework Security  
 Storing sensitive information (such as a password) can affect the security of your application. Using Windows Authentication (also known as integrated security) is a more secure way to control access to a database. For more information, see [Protecting Connection Information](../Topic/Protecting%20Connection%20Information.md).
