# The property &lt;property name&gt; cannot be deleted because it is participating in the association &lt;association name&gt;

### To correct this error  
  
1.  Select the association line on the O/R Designer that connects the data classes indicated in the error message.  
  
2.  Double-click the line to open the **Association Editor** dialog box.  
  
3.  Remove the property from the **Association Properties**.  
  
4.  Try to delete the property again.
