# Extend the functionality of a TableAdapter
You can extend the functionality of a TableAdapter by adding code to the TableAdapter's partial class file.  
  
 The code that defines a TableAdapter is regenerated when any changes are made to the TableAdapter in the **Dataset Designer**, or when a wizard  modifies the configuration of a TableAdapter. To prevent your code from being deleted during the regeneration of a TableAdapter, add code to the TableAdapter's partial class file.  
  
 Partial classes allow code for a specific class to be divided among multiple physical files. For more information, see [Partial](../Topic/Partial%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md) or [partial (Type)](../Topic/partial%20\(Type\)%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md).  
  
## Locate TableAdapters in code  
 While TableAdapters are designed with the **Dataset Designer**, the TableAdapter classes that are generated are not  nested classes of <xref:System.Data.DataSet>. TableAdapters are located in a namespace based on the name of the TableAdapter's associated dataset. For example, if your application contains a dataset named `HRDataSet`, the TableAdapters would be located in the `HRDataSetTableAdapters` namespace. (The naming convention follows this pattern: *DatasetName* + `TableAdapters`).  
  
 The following example assumes a TableAdapter named `CustomersTableAdapter`is in a project with `NorthwindDataSet`.  
  
#### To create a partial class for a TableAdapter  
  
1.  Add a new class to your project by going to the **Project** menu and selecting**Add Class**.  
  
2.  Name the class `CustomersTableAdapterExtended`.  
  
3.  Select**Add**.  
  
4.  Replace the code with the correct namespace and partial class name for your project as follows:  
  
     [!code[VbRaddataTableAdapters#2](../data-tools/codesnippet/CSharp/extend-the-functionality-of-a-tableadapter_1.cs)]
[!code[VbRaddataTableAdapters#2](../data-tools/codesnippet/VisualBasic/extend-the-functionality-of-a-tableadapter_1.vb)]
