# Connecting to Data in Visual Studio
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] provides tools to connect your application to data from many different sources, such as databases, services, and objects.

The following topics explain how to create connections to databases, services, and objects from your application.
