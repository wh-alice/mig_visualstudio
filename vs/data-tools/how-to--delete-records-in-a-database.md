# How to: Delete Records in a Database
To delete records from a database, use the `TableAdapter.Update` method or the `TableAdapter.Delete` method. Or, if your application does not use TableAdapters, you can use command objects to delete records from a database (for example, <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery*>).  
  
 The `TableAdapter.Update` method is typically used when your application uses datasets to store data, whereas the `TableAdapter.Delete` method is typically used when your application uses objects to store data.  
  
 If your TableAdapter does not have a `Delete` method, it means either the TableAdapter is configured to use stored procedures, or its `GenerateDBDirectMethods` property is set to `false`. Try setting the TableAdapter's `GenerateDBDirectMethods` property to `true` from within the [Dataset Designer](../data-tools/creating-and-editing-typed-datasets.md) and then save the dataset to regenerate the TableAdapter. If the TableAdapter still does not have a `Delete` method, then the table probably does not provide enough schema information to distinguish between individual rows (for example, no primary key is set on the table).  
  
## Delete Records Using TableAdapters  
 TableAdapters provide different ways to delete records from a database depending on the requirements of your application.  
  
 If your application uses datasets to store data you can simply delete records from the desired <xref:System.Data.DataTable> in the <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, and then call the `TableAdapter.Update` method. The `TableAdapter.Update` method takes any changes in the data table and sends those changes to the database (including inserted, updated, and deleted records).  
  
#### To delete records from a database using the TableAdapter.Update method  
  
-   Delete records from the desired <xref:System.Data.DataTable> by deleting <xref:System.Data.DataRow> objects from the table. For more information, see [How to: Delete Rows in a DataTable](../Topic/How%20to:%20Delete%20Rows%20in%20a%20DataTable.md). After the rows are deleted from the <xref:System.Data.DataTable>, call the `TableAdapter.Update` method. You can control the amount of data to update by passing in an entire <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, a <xref:System.Data.DataTable>, an array of <xref:System.Data.DataRow>s, or a single <xref:System.Data.DataRow>. The following code shows how to delete a record from a <xref:System.Data.DataTable> and then call the `TableAdapter.Update` method to communicate the change and delete the row from the database. (This example uses the Northwind database's `Region` table.)

     [!code-cs[VbRaddataSaving#20](../data-tools/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to--delete-records-in-a-database_1.cs)]  
  
 If your application uses objects to store the data in your application, you can use the TableAdapter's DBDirect methods to delete data directly from the database. Calling the `Delete` method removes records from the database based on the parameter values passed in.  
  
#### To delete records from a database using the TableAdapter.Delete method  
  
-   Call the TableAdapter's `Delete` method, passing in the values for each column as parameters of the `Delete` method. (This example uses the Northwind database's `Region` table.)  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you do not have an instance available, instantiate the TableAdapter you want to use.

## Delete Records Using Command Objects  
 The following example deletes records directly from a database using command objects. For more information on using command objects to execute commands and stored procedures, see [Fetching Data into Your Application](../data-tools/fetching-data-into-your-application.md).  
  
#### To delete records from a database using command objects  
  
-   Create a new command object, set its `Connection`, `CommandType`, and `CommandText` properties. (This example uses the Northwind database's `Region` table.)

## .NET Framework Security  
 You must have access to the database you are trying to connect to, as well as permission to delete records from the desired table.
