# One or more selected items contain a data type that is not supported by the designer
One or more of the items dragged from **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer** onto the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../data-tools/includes/vs_ordesigner_short_md.md)] contains a data type that is not supported by the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../data-tools/includes/vs_ordesigner_short_md.md)] (for example, [CLR User-Defined Types](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/9f70e0b0-3a0d-4eb1-b914-07a5d0c167c2)).  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Create a view that is based on the desired table and that does not include the unsupported data type.  
  
2.  Drag the view from **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer** onto the designer.
