# C28310
warning 28310: The <annotation_name> annotation on \<function> \<parameter> has no SAL version.  
  
 All SAL annotations used in source code should have an annotation version applied by the use of SAL_name. This needs to be corrected in the macro definition.  
  
 This warning is reported only once per declaration. Inspect the rest of the declaration for more obsolete SAL.
