# C28311
warning 28311: The <annotation_name> annotation on \<function> \<parameter> is an obsolescent version of SAL.  
  
 The annotation is an old version and should be updated to the equivalent [SAL2](../code-quality/using-sal-annotations-to-reduce-c-c---code-defects.md). This warning is not emitted if a prior inconsistent annotation warning has been emitted, and is reported only once per declaration. Inspect the rest of the declaration for more obsolete SAL.
