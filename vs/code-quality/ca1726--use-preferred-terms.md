## Cause  
 The name of an externally visible identifier includes a term for which an alternative, preferred term exists. Alternatively, the name includes the term Flag or Flags.  
  
## Rule Description  
 This rule parses an identifier into tokens. Each single token and each contiguous dual token combination is compared to terms that are built into the rule and in the Deprecated section of any custom dictionaries. The following table shows the terms that are built into the rule and their preferred alternatives.  
  
|Obsolete term|Preferred term|  
|-------------------|--------------------|  
|Arent|AreNot|  
|Cancelled|Canceled|  
|Cant|Cannot|  
|ComPlus|EnterpriseServices|  
|Couldnt|CouldNot|  
|Didnt|DidNot|  
|Doesnt|DoesNot|  
|Dont|DoNot|  
|Flag or Flags|There is no replacement term. Do not use.|  
|Hadnt|HadNot|  
|Hasnâ€™t|HasNot|  
|Havent|HaveNot|  
|Indices|Indexes|  
|Isnt|IsNot|  
|LogIn|LogOn|  
|LogOut|LogOff|  
|Shouldnt|ShouldNot|  
|SignOn|SignIn|  
|SignOff|SignOut|  
|Wasnt|WasNot|  
|Werent|WereNot|  
|Wont|WillNot|  
|Wouldnt|WouldNot|  
|Writeable|Writable|  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, replace the term with the preferred alternative term.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Suppress a warning from this rule only if the name of the identifier is intentional and relates specifically to the original term instead of the preferred term.
