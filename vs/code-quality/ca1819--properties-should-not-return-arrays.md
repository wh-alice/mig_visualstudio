## Cause  
 A public or protected property in a public type returns an array.  
  
## Rule Description  
 Arrays returned by properties are not write-protected, even if the property is read-only. To keep the array tamper-proof, the property must return a copy of the array. Typically, users will not understand the adverse performance implications of calling such a property. Specifically, they might use the property as an indexed property.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, either make the property a method or change the property to return a collection.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Attributes can contain properties that return arrays, but cannot contain properties that return collections. You can suppress a warning that is raised for a property of an attribute that is derived from the [System.Attribute](assetId:///System.Attribute?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) class. Otherwise, do not suppress a warning from this rule.  
  
## Example Violation  
  
### Description  
 The following example shows a property that violates this rule.  
  
### Code  
 [!CODE [FxCop.Performance.PropertyArrayViolation#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Performance.PropertyArrayViolation#1)]  
  
### Comments  
 To fix a violation of this rule, either make the property a method or change the property to return a collection instead of an array.  
  
## Change the Property to a Method Example  
  
### Description  
 The following example fixes the violation by changing the property to a method.  
  
### Code  
 [!CODE [FxCop.Performance.PropertyArrayFixedMethod#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Performance.PropertyArrayFixedMethod#1)]  
  
## Return a Collection Example  
  
### Description  
 The following example fixes the violation by changing the property to return a  
  
 <xref:System.Collection.ObjectModel.ReadOnlyCollection?displayProperty=fullName>.  
  
### Code  
 [!CODE [FxCop.Performance.PropertyArrayFixedCollection#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Performance.PropertyArrayFixedCollection#1)]  
  
## Allowing Users to Modify a Property  
  
### Description  
 You might want to allow the consumer of the class to modify a property. The following example shows a read/write property that violates this rule.  
  
### Code  
 [!CODE [FxCop.Performance.PropertyModifyViolation#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Performance.PropertyModifyViolation#1)]  
  
### Comments  
 The following example fixes the violation by changing the property to return a <xref:System.Collection.ObjectModel.Collection?displayProperty=fullName>.  
  
### Code  
 [!CODE [FxCop.Performance.PropertyModifyFixed#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Performance.PropertyModifyFixed#1)]
