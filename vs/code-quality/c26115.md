# C26115
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../code-quality/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C26115: Failing to release lock \<lock> in function \<func>.  
  
 Enforcement of syntactically scoped lock *acquire* and lock *release* pairs in C/C++ programs is not performed by the language. A function may introduce a locking side effect by making an observable modification to the concurrency state. For example, a lock wrapper function increments the number of lock acquisitions, or lock count, for a given lock.  
  
 You can annotate a function that has a side effect from a lock acquire or lock release by using `_Acquires_lock_` or `_Releases_lock_`, respectively. Without such annotations, a function is expected not to change any lock count after it returns. If acquires and releases are not balanced, they are considered to be *orphaned*. Warning C26115 is issued when a function introduces an orphaned lock.  
  
## Example  
 The following example generates warning C26115 because there is an orphaned lock in a function that is not annotated with `_Acquires_lock_`.  
  
```  
  
typedef struct _DATA   
{  
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;  
} DATA;  
  
void FailToReleaseLock(int flag, DATA* p)   
{  
    EnterCriticalSection(&p->cs);   
  
    if (flag)  
        return; // Warning C26115  
  
    LeaveCriticalSection(&p->cs);  
}  
  
```
