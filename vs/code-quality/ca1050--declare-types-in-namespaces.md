## Cause  
 A public or protected type is defined outside the scope of a named namespace.  
  
## Rule Description  
 Types are declared in namespaces to prevent name collisions, and as a way to organize related types in an object hierarchy. Types that are outside any named namespace are in a global namespace that cannot be referenced in code.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, place the type in a namespace.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Although you never have to suppress a warning from this rule, it is safe to do this when the assembly will never be used together with other assemblies.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows a library that has a type incorrectly declared outside a namespace, and a type that has the same name declared in a namespace.  
  
 [!code[FxCop.Design.TypesLiveInNamespaces#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1050--declare-types-in-namespaces_1.cs)]
[!code[FxCop.Design.TypesLiveInNamespaces#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/VisualBasic/ca1050--declare-types-in-namespaces_1.vb)]  
  
## Example  
 The following application uses the library that was defined previously. Note that the type that is declared outside a namespace is created when the name `Test` is not qualified by a namespace. Note also that to access the `Test` type in `Goodspace`, the namespace name is required.
