## Cause  
 A public or protected type implements the addition or subtraction operators without implementing the equality operator.  
  
## Rule Description  
 When instances of a type can be combined by using operations such as addition and subtraction, you should almost always define equality to return `true` for any two instances that have the same constituent values.  
  
 You cannot use the default equality operator in an overloaded implementation of the equality operator. Doing so will cause a stack overflow. To implement the equality operator, use the Object.Equals method in your implementation. See the following example.  
  
```vb  
If (Object.ReferenceEquals(left, Nothing)) Then  
    Return Object.ReferenceEquals(right, Nothing)  
Else  
    Return left.Equals(right)  
End If  
```  
  
```c#  
if (Object.ReferenceEquals(left, null))   
    return Object.ReferenceEquals(right, null);  
return left.Equals(right);  
```  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, implement the equality operator so that it is mathematically consistent with the addition and subtraction operators.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule when the default implementation of the equality operator provides the correct behavior for the type.  
  
## Example  
 The following example defines a type (`BadAddableType`) that violates this rule. This type should implement the equality operator to make any two instances that have the same field values test `true` for equality. The type `GoodAddableType` shows the corrected implementation. Note that this type also implements the inequality operator and overrides <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> to satisfy other rules. A complete implementation would also implement <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A>.  
  
 [!code-cs[FxCop.Design.AddAndSubtract#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1013--overload-operator-equals-on-overloading-add-and-subtract_1.cs)]  
  
## Example  
 The following example tests for equality by using instances of the types that were previously defined in this topic to illustrate the default and correct behavior for the equality operator.  
  
 [!code-cs[FxCop.Design.TestAddAndSubtract#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1013--overload-operator-equals-on-overloading-add-and-subtract_2.cs)]  
  
 This example produces the following output.  
  
 **Bad type:  {2,2} {2,2} are equal? No**  
**Good type: {3,3} {3,3} are equal? Yes**  
**Good type: {3,3} {3,3} are == ?   Yes**  
**Bad type:  {2,2} {9,9} are equal? No**  
**Good type: {3,3} {9,9} are == ?   No**
