## Cause  
 A type that is specifically marked as visible to Component Object Model (COM) contains a `public``static` method.  
  
## Rule Description  
 COM does not support `static` methods.  
  
 This rule ignores property and event accessors, operator overloading methods, or methods that are marked by using either the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute or the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute.  
  
 By default, the following are visible to COM: assemblies, public types, public instance members in public types, and all members of public value types.  
  
 For this rule to occur, an assembly-level <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisibleAttribute> must be set to `false` and the class- <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisibleAttribute> must be set to `true`, as the following code shows.  
  
```c#  
using System;  
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;   
  
[assembly: ComVisible(false)]   
namespace Samples  
{      
    [ComVisible(true)]  
    public class MyClass  
    {  
        public static void DoSomething()  
        {  
        }  
    }  
}  
```  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, change the design to use an instance method that provides the same functionality as the `static` method.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule if a COM client does not require access to the functionality that is provided by the `static` method.  
  
## Example Violation  
  
### Description  
 The following example shows a `static` method that violates this rule.  
  
### Code  
 [!code-cs[FxCop.Interoperability.ComVisibleStaticMembersViolation#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1407--avoid-static-members-in-com-visible-types_1.cs)]  
  
### Comments  
 In this example, the **Book.FromPages** method cannot be called from COM.  
  
## Example Fix  
  
### Description  
 To fix the violation in the previous example, you could change the method to an instance method, but that does not make sense in this instance. A better solution is to explicitly apply `ComVisible(false)` to the method to make it clear to other developers that the method cannot be seen from COM.  
  
 The following example applies <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute> to the method.
