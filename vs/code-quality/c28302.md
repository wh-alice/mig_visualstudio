# C28302
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../code-quality/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28302: For C++ reference-parameter <parameter_name>, an extra `_Deref_` operator was found on \<annotation>.  
  
 This warning is reported when an extra level of `_Deref_` is used on a parameter.  
  
 SAL2 does not require the use of an extra level of `_Deref_` when dealing with reference parameters. This particular annotation is unambiguous and is interpreted correctly, but should be corrected.  
  
 Frequently this can be corrected by simply removing the older `__deref` annotation and using SAL2 syntax. Sometimes may be necessary to use `_At_` to reference the specific object to be annotated.
