# C6299
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../code-quality/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6299: explicitly comparing a bit field to a Boolean type will yield unexpected results  
  
 This warning indicates an incorrect assumption that Booleans and bit fields are equivalent. Assigning 1 to bit fields will place 1 in its single bit; however, any comparison of this bit field to 1 includes an implicit cast of the bit field to a signed int. This cast will convert the stored 1 to a -1 and the comparison can yield unexpected results.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
struct myBits  
{  
  short flag : 1;  
  short done : 1;  
  //other members  
} bitType;  
  
void f( )  
{  
  if (bitType.flag == 1)   
  {  
  // code...  
  }  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use a bit field as shown in the following code:  
  
```  
void f ()  
{  
  if(bitType.flag==bitType.done)  
  {  
    // code...  
  }  
}  
```
