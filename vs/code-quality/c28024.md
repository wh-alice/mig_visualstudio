# C28024
warning C28024: The function pointer being assigned to is annotated with the function class \<class>, which is not contained in the function class(es) \<classlist>.  
  
 This warning is reported when both functions were annotated with a function class, but the classes do not match.  
  
 this warning is issued when a function pointer has a `_Function_class_` annotation that specifies that only functions of a particular functional class should be assigned to it. In an assignment or implied assignment in a function call, the source and target must be of the same function class, but the function classes do not match.
