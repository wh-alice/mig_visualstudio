## Cause  
 A public or nested public reference type overloads the equality operator.  
  
## Rule Description  
 For reference types, the default implementation of the equality operator is almost always correct. By default, two references are equal only if they point to the same object.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, remove the implementation of the equality operator.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule when the reference type behaves like a built-in value type. If it is meaningful to do addition or subtraction on instances of the type, it is probably correct to implement the equality operator and suppress the violation.  
  
## Example  
 The following example demonstrates the default behavior when comparing two references.  
  
 [!code[FxCop.Design.RefTypesNoEqualityOp#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1046--do-not-overload-operator-equals-on-reference-types_1.cs)]  
  
## Example  
 The following application compares some references.  
  
 [!code[FxCop.Design.TestRefTypesNoEqualityOp#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1046--do-not-overload-operator-equals-on-reference-types_2.cs)]  
  
 This example produces the following output.  
  
 **a = new (2,2) and b = new (2,2) are equal? No**  
**c and a are equal? Yes**  
**b and a are == ? No**  
**c and a are == ? Yes**
