# Interoperability Warnings
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../code-quality/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Interoperability warnings support interaction with COM clients.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Rule|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CA1400: P/Invoke entry points should exist](../code-quality/ca1400--p-invoke-entry-points-should-exist.md)|A public or protected method is marked by using the System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute attribute. Either the unmanaged library could not be located or the method could not be matched to a function in the library.|  
|[CA1401: P/Invokes should not be visible](../code-quality/ca1401--p-invokes-should-not-be-visible.md)|A public or protected method in a public type has the System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute attribute (also implemented by the Declare keyword in Visual Basic). Such methods should not be exposed.|  
|[CA1402: Avoid overloads in COM visible interfaces](../code-quality/ca1402--avoid-overloads-in-com-visible-interfaces.md)|When overloaded methods are exposed to COM clients, only the first method overload retains its name. Subsequent overloads are uniquely renamed by appending to the name an underscore character (_) and an integer that corresponds to the order of declaration of the overload.|  
|[CA1403: Auto layout types should not be COM visible](../code-quality/ca1403--auto-layout-types-should-not-be-com-visible.md)|A COM-visible value type is marked by using the System.Runtime.InteropServices.StructLayoutAttribute attribute set to LayoutKind.Auto. The layout of these types can change between versions of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)], which will break COM clients that expect a specific layout.|  
|[CA1404: Call GetLastError immediately after P/Invoke](../code-quality/ca1404--call-getlasterror-immediately-after-p-invoke.md)|A call is made to the Marshal.GetLastWin32Error method or the equivalent [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../code-quality/includes/tla2sharptla_win32_md.md)] GetLastError function, and the immediately previous call is not to a platform invoke method.|  
|[CA1405: COM visible type base types should be COM visible](../code-quality/ca1405--com-visible-type-base-types-should-be-com-visible.md)|A COM-visible type derives from a type that is not COM-visible.|  
|[CA1406: Avoid Int64 arguments for Visual Basic 6 clients](../code-quality/ca1406--avoid-int64-arguments-for-visual-basic-6-clients.md)|Visual Basic 6 COM clients cannot access 64-bit integers.|  
|[CA1407: Avoid static members in COM visible types](../code-quality/ca1407--avoid-static-members-in-com-visible-types.md)|COM does not support static methods.|  
|[CA1408: Do not use AutoDual ClassInterfaceType](../code-quality/ca1408--do-not-use-autodual-classinterfacetype.md)|Types that use a dual interface enable clients to bind to a specific interface layout. Any changes in a future version to the layout of the type or any base types will break COM clients that bind to the interface. By default, if the ClassInterfaceAttribute attribute is not specified, a dispatch-only interface is used.|  
|[CA1409: Com visible types should be creatable](../code-quality/ca1409--com-visible-types-should-be-creatable.md)|A reference type that is specifically marked as visible to COM contains a public parameterized constructor but does not contain a public default (parameterless) constructor. A type without a public default constructor is not creatable by COM clients.|  
|[CA1410: COM registration methods should be matched](../code-quality/ca1410--com-registration-methods-should-be-matched.md)|A type declares a method that is marked by using the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute but does not declare a method that is marked by using the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute, or vice versa.|  
|[CA1411: COM registration methods should not be visible](../code-quality/ca1411--com-registration-methods-should-not-be-visible.md)|A method that is marked by using the System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute attribute or the System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute attribute is externally visible.|  
|[CA1412: Mark ComSource Interfaces as IDispatch](../code-quality/ca1412--mark-comsource-interfaces-as-idispatch.md)|A type is marked by using the System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComSourceInterfacesAttribute attribute, and at least one of the specified interfaces is not marked by using the System.Runtime.InteropServices.InterfaceTypeAttribute attribute set to ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIDispatch.|  
|[CA1413: Avoid non-public fields in COM visible value types](../code-quality/ca1413--avoid-non-public-fields-in-com-visible-value-types.md)|Nonpublic instance fields of COM-visible value types are visible to COM clients. Review the content of the fields for information that should not be exposed, or that will have unintended design or security effects.|  
|[CA1414: Mark boolean P/Invoke arguments with MarshalAs](../code-quality/ca1414--mark-boolean-p-invoke-arguments-with-marshalas.md)|The Boolean data type has multiple representations in unmanaged code.|  
|[CA1415: Declare P/Invokes correctly](../code-quality/ca1415--declare-p-invokes-correctly.md)|This rule looks for platform invoke method declarations that target [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../code-quality/includes/tla2sharptla_win32_md.md)] functions that have a pointer to an OVERLAPPED structure parameter and the corresponding managed parameter is not a pointer to a <xref:System.Threading.NativeOverlapped?displayProperty=fullName> structure.|
