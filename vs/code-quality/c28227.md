Warning C28227: Annotation cannot also be a PrimOp (see prior declaration)  
  
 This warning indicates that the named annotation is being declared as an ordinary annotation, and also was previously declared as a PrimOp. This should not be possible if the standard macros are being used for annotations; this warning is not expected to be seen in typical use.
