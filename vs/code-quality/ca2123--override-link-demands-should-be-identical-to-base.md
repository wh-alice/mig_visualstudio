## Cause  
 A public or protected method in a public type overrides a method or implements an interface, and does not have the same [Link Demands](../Topic/Link%20Demands.md) as the interface or virtual method.  
  
## Rule Description  
 This rule matches a method to its base method, which is either an interface or a virtual method in another type, and then compares the link demands on each. A violation is reported if either the method or the base method has a link demand and the other does not.  
  
 If this rule is violated, a malicious caller can bypass the link demand merely by calling the unsecured method.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, apply the same link demand to the overide method or implementation. If this is not possible, mark the method with a full demand or remove the attribute altogether.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows various violations of this rule.
