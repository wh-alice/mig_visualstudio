## Cause  
 The names of two types, members, parameters, or fully qualified namespaces are identical when they are converted to lowercase.  
  
## Rule Description  
 Identifiers for namespaces, types, members, and parameters cannot differ only by case because languages that target the common language runtime are not required to be case-sensitive. For example, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] is a widely used case-insensitive language.  
  
 This rule fires on publicly visible members only.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 Select a name that is unique when it is compared to other identifiers in a case-insensitive manner.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. The library might not be usable in all available languages in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)].  
  
## Example of a Violation  
 The following example demonstrates a violation of this rule.  
  
 [!code[FxCop.Naming.IdentifiersShouldDifferByMoreThanCase#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1708--identifiers-should-differ-by-more-than-case_1.cs)]
