## Cause  
 A public or protected member has a [Link Demands](../Topic/Link%20Demands.md) and is called by a member that does not perform any security checks.  
  
## Rule Description  
 A link demand checks the permissions of the immediate caller only. If a member `X` makes no security demands of its callers, and calls code protected by a link demand, a caller without the necessary permission can use `X` to access the protected member.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 Add a security [Data and Modeling](../Topic/Data%20and%20Modeling%20in%20the%20.NET%20Framework.md) or link demand to the member so that it no longer provides unsecured access to the link demand-protected member.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 To safely suppress a warning from this rule, you must make sure that your code does not grant its callers access to operations or resources that can be used in a destructive manner.  
  
## Example  
 The following examples show a library that violates the rule, and an application that demonstrates the library's weakness. The sample library provides two methods that together violate the rule. The `EnvironmentSetting` method is secured by a link demand for unrestricted access to environment variables. The `DomainInformation` method makes no security demands of its callers before it calls `EnvironmentSetting`.  
  
 [!code[FxCop.Security.UnsecuredDoNotCall#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca2122--do-not-indirectly-expose-methods-with-link-demands_1.cs)]  
  
## Example  
 The following application calls the unsecured library member.  
  
 [!code[FxCop.Security.TestUnsecuredDoNot1#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca2122--do-not-indirectly-expose-methods-with-link-demands_2.cs)]  
  
 This example produces the following output.  
  
 **Value from unsecured member: seattle.corp.contoso.com**
