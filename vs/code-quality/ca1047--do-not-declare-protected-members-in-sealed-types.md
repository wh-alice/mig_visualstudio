# CA1047: Do not declare protected members in sealed types

## Cause  
 A public type is `sealed` (`NotInheritable` in Visual basic) and declares a protected member or a protected nested type. This rule does not report violations for <xref:System.Object.Finalize*> methods, which must follow this pattern.  
  
## Rule Description  
 Types declare protected members so that inheriting types can access or override the member. By definition, you cannot inherit from a sealed type, which means that protected methods on sealed types cannot be called.  
  
 The C# compiler issues a warning for this error.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, change the access level of the member to private, or make the type inheritable.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Leaving the type in its current state can cause maintenance issues and does not provide any benefits.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows a type that violates this rule.
