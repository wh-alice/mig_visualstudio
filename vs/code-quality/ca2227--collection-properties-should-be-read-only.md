## Cause  
 An externally visible writable property is a type that implements <xref:System.Collections.ICollection?displayProperty=fullName>. Arrays, indexers (properties with the name 'Item'), and permission sets are ignored by the rule.  
  
## Rule Description  
 A writable collection property allows a user to replace the collection with a completely different collection. A read-only property stops the collection from being replaced but still allows the individual members to be set. If replacing the collection is a goal, the preferred design pattern is to include a method to remove all the elements from the collection and a method to re-populate the collection. See the <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.Clear%2A> and <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.AddRange%2A> methods of the <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList?displayProperty=fullName> class for an example of this pattern.  
  
 Both binary and XML serialization support read-only properties that are collections. The <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer?displayProperty=fullName> class has specific requirements for types that implement <xref:System.Collections.ICollection> and <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable?displayProperty=fullName> in order to be serializable.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, make the property read-only and, if the design requires it, add methods to clear and re-populate the collection.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows a type with a writable collection property and shows how the collection can be replaced directly. Additionally, the preferred manner of replacing a read-only collection property using `Clear` and `AddRange` methods is shown.
