# C6314
warning C6314: Incorrect order of operations: bitwise-or has higher precedence than the conditional-expression operator. Add parentheses to clarify intent  
  
 This message indicates that an expression that contains a bitwise-or operator (`|`) was detected in the tested expression of a conditional operation (`?:`).  
  
 The conditional operator has lower precedence than bitwise operators. If the tested expression should contain the bitwise-or operator, then parentheses should be added around the conditional-expression.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
int SystemState();  
  
int f(int SignalValue)  
{  
  return SystemState() | (SignalValue != 0) ? 1 : 0;  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
```  
int SystemState();  
  
int f(int SignalValue)  
{  
  return SystemState() | ((SignalValue != 0) ? 1 : 0);  
}   
```
