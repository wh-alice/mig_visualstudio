## Cause  
 A thread attempts to acquire a lock on an object that has a weak identity.  
  
## Rule Description  
 An object is said to have a weak identity when it can be directly accessed across application domain boundaries. A thread that tries to acquire a lock on an object that has a weak identity can be blocked by a second thread in a different application domain that has a lock on the same object. The following types have a weak identity and are flagged by the rule:  
  
-   <xref:System.MarshalByRefObject>  
  
-   <xref:System.ExecutionEngineException>  
  
-   <xref:System.OutOfMemoryException>  
  
-   <xref:System.StackOverflowException>  
  
-   <xref:System.String>  
  
-   <xref:System.Reflection.MemberInfo>  
  
-   <xref:System.Reflection.ParameterInfo>  
  
-   <xref:System.Threading.Thread>  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, use an object from a type that is not in the list in the Description section.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
