# CA1001: Types that own disposable fields should be disposable
|||  
|-|-|  
|TypeName|TypesThatOwnDisposableFieldsShouldBeDisposable|  
|CheckId|CA1001|  
|Category|Microsoft.Design|  
|Breaking Change|Non-breaking - If the type is not visible outside the assembly.<br /><br /> Breaking - If the type is visible outside the assembly.|  
  
## Cause  
 A class declares and implements an instance field that is a <xref:System.IDisposable?displayProperty=fullName> type and the class does not implement <xref:System.IDisposable>.  
  
## Rule Description  
 A class implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface to dispose of unmanaged resources that it owns. An instance field that is an <xref:System.IDisposable> type indicates that the field owns an unmanaged resource. A class that declares an <xref:System.IDisposable> field indirectly owns an unmanaged resource and should implement the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. If the class does not directly own any unmanaged resources, it should not implement a finalizer.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, implement <xref:System.IDisposable> and from the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose*?displayProperty=fullName> method call the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose*> method of the field.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows a class that violates the rule and a class that satisfies the rule by implementing <xref:System.IDisposable>. The class does not implement a finalizer because the class does not directly own any unmanaged resources.
