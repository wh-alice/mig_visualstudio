# C28108
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../code-quality/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28108: Variable holds an unexpected resource  
  
 The resource that the driver is using is in the expected C language type, but has a different semantic type.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example generates this warning:  
  
```  
KeAcquireInStackSpinLock(spinLock, lockHandle);  
...  
KeReleaseSpinLock(spinLock, 0);  
```  
  
 The following code example avoids this warning:  
  
```  
KeAcquireInStackSpinLock(spinLock, lockHandle);  
...  
KeReleaseInStackSpinLock(lockHandle);  
```
