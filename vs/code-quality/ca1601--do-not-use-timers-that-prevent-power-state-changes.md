## Cause  
 A timer has an interval set to occur more than one time per second.  
  
## Rule Description  
 Do not poll more often than one time per second or use timers that occur more frequently than one time per second. Higher-frequency periodic activity will keep the CPU busy and interfere with power-saving idle timers that turn off the display and hard disks.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 Set timer intervals to occur less than one time per second.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 This rule should be suppressed only if firing the timer more than one time per second is required and mobility considerations can safely be ignored.
