# C28164
warning C28164: The argument is being passed to a function that expects a pointer to an object (not a pointer to a pointer)  
  
 This warning is reported when a pointer to a pointer is used in a call to a function that is expecting a pointer to an object.  
  
 The function takes a PVOID in this position. Usually, this indicates that &p*XXX* was used when p*XXX* is required.  
  
 Some *polymorphic functions* (functions that can evaluate to, and be applied to, values of different types) are implemented in C by using a PVOID argument that takes any pointer type. However, this allows the programmer to code a pointer to a pointer without causing a compiler error, even when this type is not appropriate.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example generates this warning:  
  
```  
PFAST_MUTEX pFm;  
...  
KeWaitForSingleObject(&pFm, UserRequest, UserMode, false, NULL);  
```  
  
 The following code example avoids the warning:  
  
```  
PFAST_MUTEX pFm;  
...  
KeWaitForSingleObject(pFm, UserRequest, UserMode, false, NULL);  
```
