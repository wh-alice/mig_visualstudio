# Mobility Warnings
Mobility warnings support efficient power usage.

|Rule|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CA1600: Do not use idle process priority](../code-quality/ca1600--do-not-use-idle-process-priority.md)|Do not set process priority to Idle. Processes that have System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass.Idle will occupy the CPU when it would otherwise be idle, and will therefore block standby.|  
|[CA1601: Do not use timers that prevent power state changes](../code-quality/ca1601--do-not-use-timers-that-prevent-power-state-changes.md)|Higher-frequency periodic activity will keep the CPU busy and interfere with power-saving idle timers that turn off the display and hard disks.|
