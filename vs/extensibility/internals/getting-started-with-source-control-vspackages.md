# Getting Started with Source Control VSPackages
A source-control VSPackage is a more advanced alternative to the source control plug-in. (See [Creating a Source Control Plug-in](../../extensibility/internals/creating-a-source-control-plug-in.md) for more information on source control plug-ins.) A source-control VSPackage enables complete control over the source control model, features, and user interface (UI), and it integrates into the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] environment as a VSPackage.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Determining Whether to Implement a Source Control VSPackage](../../extensibility/internals/determining-whether-to-implement-a-source-control-vspackage.md)  
 Explains the choices for source control solutions and provides broad guidelines for choosing an appropriate integration path.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [What's New in Source Control](../../extensibility/internals/what-s-new-in-source-control.md)  
 Describes new features using VSPackages with source control.  
  
 [Creating a Source Control VSPackage](../../extensibility/internals/creating-a-source-control-vspackage.md)  
 Discusses how to create a source control VSPackage that not only supplies source control functionality but can be used to customize the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] source control UI.
