# Source Control
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../code-quality/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This section discusses the options for implementing source control as an integrated feature of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], either through a source control plug-in or a source control VSPackage.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Essentials](../../extensibility/internals/source-control-integration-essentials.md)  
 Presents the important information that you must have to start working with source control.  
  
 [Overview](../../extensibility/internals/source-control-integration-overview.md)  
 An overview of the two available options for implementing source control.  
  
 [Creating a Source Control Plug-in](../../extensibility/internals/creating-a-source-control-plug-in.md)  
 Discusses how to create a source control plug-in that supplies source control functionality through the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] source control user interface (UI).  
  
 [Creating a Source Control VSPackage](../../extensibility/internals/creating-a-source-control-vspackage.md)  
 Discusses how to create a source control VSPackage that not only supplies source control functionality but can be used to customize the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] source control UI.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Source Control Plug-ins](../../extensibility/source-control-plug-ins.md)  
 Reference for the Source Control Plug-in API.  
  
 [Extending Projects](../../extensibility/extending-projects.md)  
 Describes how to use [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] projects and solutions to organize code files and resource files, and how to implement source control.
