# Optimizing Menu and Toolbar Commands
The addition of VSPackages and their corresponding commands to [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] may cause a crowded UI. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] provides ways to help minimize UI command confusion.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Making Commands Available](../../extensibility/internals/making-commands-available.md)  
 Provides general guidelines for minimizing crowding of the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] UI when you add VSPackages.  
  
 [Placement Guidelines](../../extensibility/internals/command-placement-guidelines.md)  
 Provides specific guidelines for implementing a VSPackage according to the size of the command set.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Commands, Menus, and Toolbars](../../extensibility/internals/commands-menus-and-toolbars.md)
