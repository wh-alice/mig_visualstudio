# About File Name Extensions
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../code-quality/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When you register a file extension of a VSPackage, you associate it with a version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. This is important if more than one version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] is installed on a computer.  
  
 File extensions for VSPackages are registered under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key with a default value that points to the associated programmatic identifier (ProgID).  
  
 The following is an example of the registration information for the .vcproj file extension:  
  
```  
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\  
   .vcproj\  
      (default)=" VisualStudio.vcproj.8.0"   
```  
  
 Files associated with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] must have a versioned ProgID, such as `VisualStudio.vcproj.8.0`, to allow side-by-side installations of the product to maintain file extension associations among product versions. A version-specific ProgID also allows you to use standard verbs, such as open, edit, and so on, without the concern of overwriting or being overwritten by other applications or versions of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  
  
 In certain cases, the ProgID associated with a file extension should not be changed. For example, the ProgID for the .htm file extension (progid = htmlfile) is hard coded in a number of places in the operating system, and is widely known and used in association with .htm and .html files.
