# Extending the Editor and Language Services
You can add language service features (such as IntelliSense) to your own editor, and extend most features of the Visual Studio code editor.  For a full list of what you can extend, see [Language Service and Editor Extension Points](../extensibility/language-service-and-editor-extension-points.md).  
  
 You extend most editor features by using the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF). For example, if the editor feature you want to extend is syntax coloring, you can write a MEF *component part* that defines the classifications for which you want different coloring and how you want them handled. The editor also supports multiple extensions of the same feature.  
  
 The editor presentation layer is based the Windows Presentation Framework (WPF). WPF provides a graphics library for flexible text formatting, and also provides visualizations such as graphics and animations.  
  
 The Visual Studio SDK provides adapters known as *shims* to support VSPackages that were written for earlier versions. Nevertheless, if you have an existing VSPackage, we recommend that you update it to the new technology to obtain better performance and reliability.
