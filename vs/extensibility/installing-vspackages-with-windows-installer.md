# Installing VSPackages With Windows Installer
Integrating your VSPackage into [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] requires more than just copying files to a user's computer. Your VSPackage's installer must install the VSPackage and its dependent files, and register and integrate them into [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. Your VSPackage can take advantage of integration features such as displaying an icon on the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] splash screen and About dialog box.  
  
 Microsoft Windows Installer files are the recommended way to distribute your VSPackages. Easy-to-use Windows Installer packages can run on any Windows operating system supported by [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. For more information, see [Windows Installer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/121be21b-b916-43e2-8f10-8b080516d2a0).
