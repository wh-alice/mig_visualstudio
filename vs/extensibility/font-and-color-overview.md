# Font and Color Overview
This topic discusses text font and color settings in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE). It also introduces the concepts of Categories and Display Items, and it describes how VSPackages and the core editor use text attributes.  
  
## The Fonts and Colors Property Page  
 You can manage attributes of displayed text in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE) through the **Fonts and Colors** property page. To find the **Fonts and Colors** property page, on the **Tools** menu, click **Options**. Expand **Environment**, and then click **Fonts and Colors**.  
  
## Categories and Display Items  
 Fonts and colors are organized into **Categories** and **Display Items**.  
  
-   A **Category** is a logical or functional container for a number of **Display Items**.  
  
     A list of **Categories** is in the **Show settings for** drop-down box of the **Fonts and Colors** property page.  
  
-   A **Display Item** is a well-defined text entity such as a comment, a string, or a control structure that is to be colorized when displayed.  
  
 Each **Display Item** is uniquely defined within the **Category** that contains it. Consequently, more than one **Category** can have a **Display Item** with the same name.  
  
## VSPackage Control of Fonts and Colors  
 The [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../extensibility/includes/vsipsdk_md.md)] allows VSPackages to:  
  
-   Define font and color **Categories**.  
  
-   Specify the fonts and colors used to present **Display Items**.  
  
-   Interact with the **Fonts and Colors** property page.  
  
-   Aggregate multiple **Categories** into groups.  
  
-   Persist changes in default settings.  
  
 There are two ways to interact with font and color selections within the [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../extensibility/includes/vsipsdk_md.md)].  
  
-   One way is referred to as *Syntax Coloring*. It is used by a VSPackage that customizes the existing [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] editor to implement a language service and create a source editor.  
  
     Only one **Category** supports this mechanism, namely, the **Text Editor**.  
  
-   A more general alternative supports all other **Categories** and user interface components other than the source editor when displaying text. For more information, see <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsFontAndColorDefaultsProvider>.  
  
## Core Editor Text Settings  
 Font and color settings for the core editor of a language service object are governed by the **Text EditorCategory** found in the **Show settings for** drop-down box of the **Fonts and Colors** property page.  
  
 When working with editors, you should use the specialized font and color control mechanism that the language service provides to control and extend the **Text Editor** settings. The mechanism is referred to as *syntax coloring* and provides:  
  
-   A simplified technique for managing the fonts and colors of display items.  
  
     For more information, see <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsProvideColorableItems> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsColorableItem>.  
  
-   A well-defined and optimized colorization mechanism.  
  
     For more information, see <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsColorizer>.  
  
-   The ability to both use built-in display items from the **Text EditorCategory** and to extend them.  
  
     For more information, see [How to: Use Built-In Colorable Items](../extensibility-internals/how-to--use-built-in-colorable-items.md) and [Custom Colorable Items](../extensibility-internals/custom-colorable-items.md).  
  
-   Automatic persistence of the current state of both built-in and custom display items with the **Text Editor** category.  
  
 For more information on syntax coloring see [Syntax Coloring in a Legacy Language Service](../extensibility-internals/syntax-coloring-in-a-legacy-language-service.md).
