# Adding Project and Project Item Templates
When you create your own project types, you must provide support for adding new projects and project items by using the standard [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE) dialog boxes. The following topics discuss different techniques for adding projects and project items.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Project Context](../extensibility/project-context.md)  
 Explains that the project provides most of the context information for what transpires in the environment.  
  
 [Project Priority](../extensibility/project-priority.md)  
 Explains that a project item is usually a member of one project to help avoid ambiguity about which project is used to open the item.  
  
 [Miscellaneous Files Project](../extensibility/miscellaneous-files-project.md)  
 Provides information about the two types of editors that can be used to open files in a project and the role the project plays in determining which editor to use when a project item is opened.  
  
 [Registering Project and Item Templates](../extensibility/registering-project-and-item-templates.md)  
 Explains what occurs when a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project is created.  
  
 [Adding Items to the Add New Item Dialog Boxes](../extensibility/adding-items-to-the-add-new-item-dialog-boxes.md)  
 Explains the process for adding items to the **Add New Item** dialog box.  
  
 [Adding Directories to the New Project Dialog Box](../extensibility/adding-directories-to-the-new-project-dialog-box.md)  
 Provides an example of registering a new directory that contains custom templates made available by a VSPackage.  
  
 [Adding Directories to the Add New Item Dialog Box](../extensibility/adding-directories-to-the-add-new-item-dialog-box.md)  
 Provides an example of registering a new set of directories for the **Add New Item** dialog box.  
  
 [IDE-Defined Commands for Extending Project Systems](../extensibility/ide-defined-commands-for-extending-project-systems.md)  
 Lists different types of command items used for extending project systems.  
  
 [CATIDs for Objects That Are Typically Used to Extend Projects](../extensibility/catids-for-objects-that-are-typically-used-to-extend-projects.md)  
 Lists CATIDs for objects that are used to extend [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../code-quality/includes/vcprvc_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../data-tools/includes/csprcs_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] project systems.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [How to: Open Project-Specific Editors](../extensibility/how-to--open-project-specific-editors.md)  
 Provides step-by-step instructions for opening an item intrinsically bound to a specific editor for a project.  
  
 [How to: Open Standard Editors](../extensibility/how-to--open-standard-editors.md)  
 Provides step-by-step instructions for opening a standard editor.  
  
 [Project Subtypes](../extensibility/project-subtypes.md)  
 Provides links to project subtype conceptual topics. Project subtypes extend existing [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../data-tools/includes/csprcs_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] projects.  
  
 [Project Types](../extensibility/project-types.md)  
 Provides links to additional topics that offer information about how to design new project types.
