# When a Breakpoint Binds or Becomes Unbound
When a breakpoint cannot be bound at the time a call is made to the [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::CanBind](../extensibility/idebugpendingbreakpoint2--canbind.md) method, the bind time and create time of the breakpoint are different.  
  
## Methods Called  
 The session debug manager (SDM) calls the following methods:  
  
1.  [IDebugEngine2::CreatePendingBreakpoint](../extensibility/idebugengine2--creatependingbreakpoint.md). The DE returns an [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2](../extensibility/idebugpendingbreakpoint2.md).  
  
2.  [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Enable](../extensibility/idebugpendingbreakpoint2--enable.md).  
  
3.  [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Virtualize](../extensibility/idebugpendingbreakpoint2--virtualize.md).  
  
4.  The [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Bind](../extensibility/idebugpendingbreakpoint2--bind.md) method and returns S_OK. The DE sends an [IDebugBreakpointBoundEvent2](../extensibility/idebugbreakpointboundevent2.md) or [IDebugBreakpointErrorEvent2](../extensibility/idebugbreakpointerrorevent2.md).  
  
5.  [IDebugBreakpointBoundEvent2::GetPendingBreakpoint](../extensibility/idebugbreakpointboundevent2--getpendingbreakpoint.md) and [IDebugBreakpointBoundEvent2::EnumBoundBreakpoints](../extensibility/idebugbreakpointboundevent2--enumboundbreakpoints.md) methods to verify and to get the bound breakpoints.
