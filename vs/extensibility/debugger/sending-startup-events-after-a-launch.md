# Sending Startup Events After a Launch
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../code-quality/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Once the debug engine (DE) is attached to the program, it sends a series of startup events back to the debug session.  
  
 Startup events sent back to the debug session include the following:  
  
-   An engine creation event.  
  
-   A program creation event.  
  
-   Thread creation and module load events.  
  
-   A load complete event, sent when the code is loaded and ready to run, but before any code is executed  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  When this event is continued, global variables are initialized and startup routines run.  
  
-   Possible other thread creation and module load events.  
  
-   An entry point event, which signals that the program has reached its main entry point, such as **Main** or `WinMain`. This event is not typically sent if the DE attaches to a program that is already running.  
  
 Programmatically, the DE first sends the session debug manager (SDM) an [IDebugEngineCreateEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugenginecreateevent2.md) interface, which represents an engine creation event, followed by an [IDebugProgramCreateEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogramcreateevent2.md), which represents a program creation event.  
  
 This is typically followed by one or more [IDebugThreadCreateEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugthreadcreateevent2.md) thread creation events and [IDebugModuleLoadEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugmoduleloadevent2.md) module load events.  
  
 When the code is loaded and ready to run, but before any code is executed, the DE sends the SDM an [IDebugLoadCompleteEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugloadcompleteevent2.md) load complete event. Finally, if the program is not already running, the DE sends an [IDebugEntryPointEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugentrypointevent2.md) entry point event, signaling that the program has reached its main entry point and is ready for debugging.
