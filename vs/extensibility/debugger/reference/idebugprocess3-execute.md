# IDebugProcess3::Execute
Continues running this process from a stopped state. Any previous execution state (such as a step) is cleared and the process starts executing again.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This method should be used instead of [Execute](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogram2-execute.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT Execute(  
   IDebugThread2* pThread  
);  
```  
  
```c#  
int Execute(  
   IDebugThread2 pThread  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pThread`  
 [in] An [IDebugThread2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugthread2.md) object representing the thread to execute.  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns error code.  
  
## Remarks  
 When the user starts execution from a stopped state in some other process's thread, this method is called on this process. This method is also called when the user selects the **Start** command from the **Debug** menu in the IDE. The implementation of this method may be as simple as calling the [Resume](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugthread2-resume.md) method on the current thread in the process.  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  Do not send a stopping event or an immediate (synchronous) event to [Event](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugeventcallback2-event.md) while handling this call; otherwise the debugger may hang.
