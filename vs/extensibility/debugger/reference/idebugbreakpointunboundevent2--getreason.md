# IDebugBreakpointUnboundEvent2::GetReason
Gets the reason the breakpoint was unbound.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT GetReason(   
   BP_UNBOUND_REASON* pdwUnboundReason  
);  
```  
  
```c#  
int GetReason(   
   out enum_ BP_UNBOUND_REASON pdwUnboundReason  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pdwUnboundReason`  
 [out] Returns a value from the [BP_UNBOUND_REASON](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp_unbound_reason.md) enumeration specifying the reason the breakpoint was unbound.  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.  
  
## Remarks  
 Reasons include a breakpoint being rebound to a different location after an edit-and-continue operation, or a determination that a breakpoint was bound in error.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to implement this method for a **CBreakpointUnboundDebugEventBase** object that exposes the [IDebugBreakpointUnboundEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointunboundevent2.md) interface.  
  
```cpp#  
STDMETHODIMP CBreakpointUnboundDebugEventBase::GetReason(  
    BP_UNBOUND_REASON* pdwUnboundReason)  
{  
    HRESULT hRes = E_FAIL;  
  
    if ( EVAL(pdwUnboundReason) )  
    {  
        *pdwUnboundReason = m_dwReason;  
  
        hRes = S_OK;  
    }  
    else  
        hRes = E_INVALIDARG;  
  
    return ( hRes );  
}  
```
