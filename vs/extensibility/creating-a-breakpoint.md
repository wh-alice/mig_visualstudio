# Creating a Breakpoint
The following describes the process of creating a breakpoint.  
  
## Methods in Breakpoint Creation  
 When the module that is needed to bind a breakpoint is loaded, the session debug manager (SDM) calls the following methods:  
  
1.  [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Enable](../extensibility/idebugpendingbreakpoint2--enable.md)  
  
2.  [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Virtualize](../extensibility/idebugpendingbreakpoint2--virtualize.md)  
  
3.  [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::CanBind](../extensibility/idebugpendingbreakpoint2--canbind.md)  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  **CanBind** is called only when a user makes a breakpoint from the Breakpoints window.  
  
4.  [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Bind](../extensibility/idebugpendingbreakpoint2--bind.md)  
  
5.  [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::EnumBoundBreakpoints](../extensibility/idebugpendingbreakpoint2--enumboundbreakpoints.md)
