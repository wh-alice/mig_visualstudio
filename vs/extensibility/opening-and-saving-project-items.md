# Opening and Saving Project Items
When you add a new project type, you must manage the opening and saving of your projects files in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE). The following topics discuss the different approaches to opening and saving files.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Displaying Files By Using the Open File Command](../extensibility/displaying-files-by-using-the-open-file-command.md)  
 Provides a step-by-step explanation of how the IDE handles the **Open File** command and the role of projects in responding to this command.  
  
 [Displaying Files By Using the Open With Command](../extensibility/displaying-files-by-using-the-open-with-command.md)  
 Provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how the IDE handles the **Open With** command, prompting the opening of a file that has some choice of standard editors.  
  
 [How to: Open Project-Specific Editors](../extensibility/how-to--open-project-specific-editors.md)  
 Provides step-by-step instructions for specifying that files of a particular type in your project should be opened by using a project-specific editor.  
  
 [How to: Open Standard Editors](../extensibility/how-to--open-standard-editors.md)  
 Provides step-by-step instructions for specifying how to enable the IDE to open a standard editor for files in your project type.  
  
 [How to: Open Editors for Open Documents](../extensibility/how-to--open-editors-for-open-documents.md)  
 Provides step-by-step instructions to open a project-specific editor for an open file.  
  
 [Saving a Standard Document](../extensibility/saving-a-standard-document.md)  
 Provides a detailed explanation of how the IDE handles the **Save**, **Save As**, and **Save All** commands for a document opened in a standard editor.  
  
 [Saving a Custom Document](../extensibility/saving-a-custom-document.md)  
 Provides a diagram and detailed explanation of how the IDE handles the **Save**, **Save As**, and **Save All** commands for documents opened in a custom editor.  
  
 [Determining Which Editor Opens a File in a Project](../extensibility/determining-which-editor-opens-a-file-in-a-project.md)  
 Discusses the process that the IDE follows to select the appropriate editor or designer for a file.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Creating Custom Editors and Designers](../extensibility/creating-custom-editors-and-designers.md)  
 Lists the four types of editors that the IDE can host and gives descriptions of each editor.  
  
 [Project Types](../extensibility/project-types.md)  
 Discusses how projects control the way that code is compiled and built, how editors are opened, and how project items are formatted.
