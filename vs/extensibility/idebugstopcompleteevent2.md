# IDebugStopCompleteEvent2
The debug engine (DE) can send this optional event to the session debug manager (SDM) when a program has stopped.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
IDebugStopCompleteEvent2 : IUnknown  
```  
  
## Notes for Implementers  
 This is a new interface for [!INCLUDE[vsprvslong](../codequality/includes/vsprvslong_md.md)]. Prior releases did not support asynchronous stopping.  
  
 [Stop](../extensibility/idebugengineprogram2--stop.md) is called by the SDM in multi-process or multi-program scenarios. When one program sends a stopping event to the SDM, the SDM requests other programs to stop, too.  
  
 It is used to asynchronously inform the SDM that a program has stopped. This is useful for an interpreter debug engine, where sometimes no code is running inside the debugged program, so [Stop](../extensibility/idebugengineprogram2--stop.md) can not be completed synchronously. If a debug engine wants to employ this asynchronous notification, it must return `S_ASYNC_STOP` from [Stop](../extensibility/idebugengineprogram2--stop.md).  
  
## Requirements  
 Header: msdbg.h  
  
 Namespace: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop
