# How to: Troubleshoot Services
There are several common problems that can occur when you try to get a service:  
  
-   The service is not registered with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  
  
-   The service is requested by interface type and not by service type.  
  
-   The VSPackage requesting the service has not been sited.  
  
-   The wrong service provider is used.  
  
 If the requested service cannot be obtained, the call to <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package.GetService*> returns null. You should always test for null after requesting a service:  
  
```c#  
IVsActivityLog log =   
    GetService(typeof(SVsActivityLog)) as IVsActivityLog;  
if (log == null) return;  
```  
  
### To troubleshoot a service  
  
1.  Examine the system registry to see whether the service has been correctly registered. For more information, see [Registering Services](../misc/registering-services.md).  
  
     The following .reg file fragment shows how the SVsTextManager service might be registered:  
  
    ```  
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\<version number>\Services\{F5E7E71D-1401-11d1-883B-0000F87579D2}]  
    @="{F5E7E720-1401-11d1-883B-0000F87579D2}"  
    "Name"="SVsTextManager"  
    ```  
  
     In the example above, version number is the version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], such as 12.0 or 14.0, the key {F5E7E71D-1401-11d1-883B-0000F87579D2} is the service identifier (SID) of the service, SVsTextManager, and the default value {F5E7E720-1401-11d1-883B-0000F87579D2} is the package GUID of the text manager VSPackage, which provides the service.  
  
2.  Use the service type and not the interface type when you call GetService. When requesting a service from [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package> extracts the GUID from the type. A service will not be found if the following conditions exist:  
  
    1.  An interface type is passed to GetService instead of the service type.  
  
    2.  No GUID is explicitly assigned to the interface. Therefore, the system creates a default GUID for an object as needed.  
  
3.  Be sure the VSPackage requesting the service has been sited. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] sites a VSPackage after constructing it and before calling <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package.Initialize*>.  
  
     If you have code in a VSPackage constructor that needs a service, move it to the Initialize method.  
  
4.  Be sure that you are using the correct service provider.  
  
     Not all service providers are alike. The service provider that [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] passes to a tool window differs from the one it passes to a VSPackage. The tool window service provider knows about <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.STrackSelection>, but does not know about <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsRunningDocumentTable>. You can call <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package.GetGlobalService*> to get a VSPackage service provider from within a tool window.  
  
     If a tool window hosts a user control or any other control container, the container will be sited by the Windows component model and will not have access to any [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] services. You can call <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package.GetGlobalService*> to get a VSPackage service provider from within a control container.
