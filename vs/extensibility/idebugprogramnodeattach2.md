# IDebugProgramNodeAttach2
Allows a program node to be notified of an attempt to attach to the associated program.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
IDebugProgramNodeAttach2 : IUnknown  
```  
  
## Notes for Implementers  
 This interface is implemented on the same class that implements the [IDebugProgramNode2](../extensibility/idebugprogramnode2.md) interface in order to receive notification of an attach operation and to provide an opportunity to cancel the attach operation.  
  
## Notes for Callers  
 Obtain this interface by calling the `QueryInterface` method in an [IDebugProgramNode2](../extensibility/idebugprogramnode2.md) object. The [OnAttach](../extensibility/idebugprogramnodeattach2--onattach.md) method must be called before the [Attach](../extensibility/idebugengine2--attach.md) method to give the program node a chance to stop the attach process.  
  
## Methods in Vtable Order  
 This interface implements the following method:  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[OnAttach](../extensibility/idebugprogramnodeattach2--onattach.md)|Attaches to the associated program or defers the attach process to the [Attach](../extensibility/idebugengine2--attach.md) method.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This interface is the preferred alternative to the deprecated [Attach_V7](../extensibility/idebugprogramnode2--attach_v7.md) method. All debug engines are always loaded with the `CoCreateInstance` function, that is, they are instantiated outside the address space of the program being debugged.  
  
 If a previous implementation of the `IDebugProgramNode2::Attach_V7` method was simply setting the `GUID` of the program being debugged, then only the [OnAttach](../extensibility/idebugprogramnodeattach2--onattach.md) method needs to be implemented.  
  
 If a previous implementation of the `IDebugProgramNode2::Attach_V7` method used the callback interface that was provided, then that functionality needs to be moved to an implementation of the [Attach](../extensibility/idebugengine2--attach.md) method and the `IDebugProgramNodeAttach2` interface does not have to be implemented.
