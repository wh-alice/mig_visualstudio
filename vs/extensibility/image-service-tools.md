# Image Service Tools
The VS SDK includes several tools to help extension builders use the Visual Studio image service.  
  
-   The [Manifest from Resources](../extensibility/manifest-from-resources.md) tool takes a list of image resources (.png or .xaml files) and generates an image manifest file.  
  
-   The [Manifest to Code](../extensibility/manifest-to-code.md) tool takes an image manifest file and generates a wrapper file to use in C++, C#, VB, or .vsct files.  
  
-   The [Image Library Viewer](../extensibility/image-library-viewer.md) can load, edit, and search image manifests.
