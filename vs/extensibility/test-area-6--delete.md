# Test Area 6: Delete
This source-control plug-in test area covers delete actions.  
  
 Source control responds to delete actions in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
 Following is a list of items that can be deleted:  
  
-   Files  
  
-   Folders  
  
-   Project  
  
 Depending on the project type, you might have the option to **Remove** the project (leaves the files on disk) or **Delete** the project (removes the files on disk). Either action removes the project or item from **Solution Explorer**.  
  
## Expected Behavior  
 The expected behavior for the test cases in the delete test area is:  
  
-   Deleted item is no longer visible within **Solution Explorer**.  
  
-   The parent of the deleted project or item is checked out as needed (possibly with a prompt.)  
  
-   After you delete a checked out or added item, it does NOT appear in the **Pending Checkins** window.  
  
-   The item still exists within the source control store, even after the deletion, and must be manually purged.  
  
|Action|Test Steps|Expected Results to Verify|  
|------------|----------------|--------------------------------|  
|Delete a client project|1.  Create a client project.<br />2.  Add the solution to source control.<br />3.  Remove the entire project from solution|Common Expected Behavior.|  
|Delete an empty file|1.  Create a client project.<br />2.  Add a zero byte file to the project.<br />3.  Add the solution to source control.<br />4.  Select the file, delete it.|Common Expected Behavior.|  
|Delete a folder with one file|1.  Create single project solution.<br />2.  Add a folder.<br />3.  Add one file to the folder.<br />4.  Add the solution to source control.<br />5.  Check out the project to avoid prompts.<br />6.  Delete the folder.|Common Expected Behavior.|  
|Delete a File System Web project|1.  Create a File System Web project (use the Browse button to specify a UNC path).<br />2.  Add the solution to source control.<br />3.  Remove the entire project from the solution.<br />4.  Repeat steps 1 through 3 for a local Web project (exercises different paths through the code but has the same external interface and behavior).|Common Expected Behavior.|  
|Delete a file from a File System Web project|1.  Create a File System Web project.<br />2.  Add the solution to source control.<br />3.  Delete a file from the project.<br />4.  Repeat steps 1 through 3 for a local Web project (exercises different paths through the code but has the same external interface and behavior).|Common Expected Behavior.|
