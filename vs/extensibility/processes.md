# Processes
In terms of the debugger architecture, a **process**:  
  
-   Is a container for a set of programs. It is closely analogous to a Windows process, which is a container for a set of threads.  
  
-   Can identify itself by name, identifier, or physical identifier.  
  
-   Can enumerate all running programs (and their threads).  
  
-   Can describe itself, the port it is running in, and the machine that contains it.  
  
-   Can create one or more programs, terminate any of the programs it creates, or cause a program to stop.  
  
-   Is represented by an [IDebugProcess2](../extensibility/idebugprocess2.md) interface, which is created when the process is launched. A process is launched by either the session debug manager (SDM) or [LaunchSuspended](../extensibility/idebugenginelaunch2--launchsuspended.md).  
  
 The debug package can attach a debug engine (DE) to a process by calling [Attach](../extensibility/idebugprocess2--attach.md). This means that the DE attaches to all possible programs running in the process that it can handle. For example, if the common language runtime DE attaches to a process, it attaches only to programs that are running managed code.
