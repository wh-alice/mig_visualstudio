# Launch-based Attachment
Launch-based attachment to a program is automatic. When the process hosting the program is launched by the SDM, launch-based attachment follows a path similar to that of the manual attachment method. For information, see [Attaching to the Program](../extensibility/attaching-to-the-program.md).  
  
## The Attaching Process  
 The main difference is the sequence of events following the **Attach** call, as follows:  
  
1.  Send an **IDebugEngineCreateEvent2** event object to the SDM. For details, see [Sending Events](../extensibility/sending-events.md).  
  
2.  Call the `IDebugProgram2::GetProgramId` method on the **IDebugProgram2** interface passed to the **Attach** method.  
  
3.  Send an **IDebugProgramCreateEvent2** event object to notify the SDM that the local **IDebugProgram2** object was created to represent the program to the DE.  
  
4.  Send an [IDebugThreadCreateEvent2](../extensibility/idebugthreadcreateevent2.md) event object to notify the SDM that a new thread is created for the process that launched.
