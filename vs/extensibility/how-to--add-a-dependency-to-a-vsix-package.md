# How to: Add a Dependency to a VSIX Package
You can set up a VSIX package deployment that installs any dependencies that are not already present on the target computer. To accomplish this, include the VSIX dependencies to the source.extension.vsixmanifest file.  
  
#### To add a dependency  
  
1.  Open the source.extension.vsixmanifest file in the **Design** view. Go to the **Dependencies** tab and click **New**.  
  
2.  To add an installed extension: in the **Add New Dependency** dialog box, select **Installed extension** and then, for the **Name**, select an extension on the list.  
  
3.  To add another VSIX that is not installed: : in the **Add New Dependency** dialog box, select **File on file system** and then use the **Browse** button to select the VSIX.
