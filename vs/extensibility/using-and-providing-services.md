# Using and Providing Services
A service is a contract between two VSPackages. One VSPackage offers a specific set of interfaces for another VSPackage to consume. For example, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] offers the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsActivityLog> service to any VSPackage it loads. This service provides the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsActivityLog> interface, which can be used to write to the activity log. For more information, see [How to: Use the Activity Log](../extensibility/how-to--use-the-activity-log.md).  
  
 VSPackages can offer services of their own by using the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IProfferService> interface..  
  
 Visual Studio offers important services, such as the following:  
  
|IDE service|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsShell>|Provides access to IDE services dealing with basic functionality, VSPackages, and the registry.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsUIShell>|Provides basic windowing and UI-related functionality in the IDE, such as the ability to create tools and document windows.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsSolution>|Provides basic solution-related functionality, such as the ability to enumerate projects, create new projects, and monitor project changes.|
