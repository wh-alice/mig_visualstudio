# How to: Clear the Undo Stack
The following procedure below explains how to clear the undo stack.  
  
### To clear the undo stack  
  
1.  To clear the undo stack use the [IOleUndoManager::DiscardFrom](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms693799) method. The following is an example of this:  
  
    ```  
    HRESULT CCmdWindow::ClearUndoStack()  
    {  
      HRESULT hr = S_OK;  
  
      if (m_pUndoMgr == NULL)  
        {  
        IfFailGo(m_pTextLines->GetUndoManager(&m_pUndoMgr));  
        ASSERT(m_pUndoMgr != NULL, "",;);  
        }  
  
      IfFailGo(m_pUndoMgr->DiscardFrom(NULL));  
  
    Error:  
      return hr;  
    }  
    ```
