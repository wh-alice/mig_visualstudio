# Core Interfaces
The following interfaces are the core interfaces for extending debugger by using the [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../extensibility/includes/vsipsdk_md.md)].  
  
## Discussion  
 These interfaces are primarily used to create the debug engine (DE). They are organized here by categories:  
  
-   [Breakpoints](#Breakpoints)  
  
-   [Contexts](#Contexts)  
  
-   [Core Server](#CoreServer)  
  
-   [Debug Engines](#DebugEngines)  
  
-   [Documents](#Documents)  
  
-   [Events](#Events)  
  
-   [Expressions](#Expressions)  
  
-   [Memory](#Memory)  
  
-   [Modules](#Modules)  
  
-   [Ports](#Ports)  
  
-   [Processes](#Processes)  
  
-   [Programs](#Programs)  
  
-   [Properties](#Properties)  
  
-   [Stack Frames](#StackFrames)  
  
-   [Threads](#Threads)  
  
-   [Type Visualizers](#TypeVisualizers)  
  
 The entities that can implement the interfaces are:  
  
-   Debug Engine (DE)  
  
-   Port Supplier (PS)  
  
-   Expression Evaluator (EE)  
  
-   Visual Studio (VS)
