# Calling Debugger Events
Events in debugging sessions occur in a specific order.  
  
## Discussion  
 To understand the pattern of calls between the debug engine (DE) and the session debug manager (SDM), the following represents the calling order of the events that occur in a typical debugging session:  
  
1.  [Attaching and detaching to a program](../extensibility/attaching-and-detaching-to-a-program.md)  
  
2.  [Launching the debugger](../extensibility/launching-the-debugger.md)  
  
3.  [Terminating a program](../extensibility/terminating-a-program.md)  
  
4.  [Creating a breakpoint](../extensibility/creating-a-breakpoint.md)  
  
5.  [When a breakpoint binds or becoming unbound](../extensibility/when-a-breakpoint-binds-or-becomes-unbound.md)  
  
6.  [Breakpoint errors](../extensibility/breakpoint-errors.md)  
  
7.  [Hitting a breakpoint](../extensibility/hitting-a-breakpoint.md)  
  
8.  [Deleting a breakpoint](../extensibility/deleting-a-breakpoint.md)  
  
9. [Entering break mode](../extensibility/entering-break-mode.md)  
  
10. [Stepping in break mode](../extensibility/stepping-in-break-mode.md)  
  
11. [Expression evaluation in break mode](../extensibility/expression-evaluation-in-break-mode.md)  
  
12. [Exception handling](../extensibility/exception-handling--visual-studio-sdk-.md)
