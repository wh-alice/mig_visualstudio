# Extending Properties
The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] **Properties** window is a universal property browser for COM and COM+ components and supports all [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] products. The **Properties** window works with `ITypeInfo` type information and COM+ metadata to list the design-time properties for the currently selected object in any other window in the integrated development environment (IDE).  
  
 The **Properties** window, which can be opened by pressing F4 on the keyboard, or selecting **Properties Window** on the **View** menu, is used to view and edit configuration-independent, design-time properties and events of selected objects. Configuration-dependent properties, associated with solutions and projects, are displayed on [Property Pages](../extensibility/property-pages.md). For more information, see [NIB:Project Properties](http://msdn.microsoft.com/fb126574-24ad-4c96-9b2b-6e1f3879ba50), [Managing Configuration Options](../extensibility/managing-configuration-options.md), and [NIB:Item Management in Projects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/762e606b-7f44-4b66-97a1-e30a703654a0).
