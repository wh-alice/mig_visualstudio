# Code Snippet Picker
The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Code Editor provides a **Code Snippet Picker** that allows you, in a few mouse clicks, to insert ready-made blocks of code into the active document.  
  
 The procedure to display the **Code Snippet Picker** varies according to the language you are using.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] - Right-click at the desired location in the Code Editor to display the Shortcut menu, and select **Insert Snippet**.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../data-tools/includes/csprcs_md.md)] - Right-click at the desired location in the Code Editor to display the Shortcut menu, and click **Insert Snippet** or **Surround With**.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../code-quality/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] - The **Code Snippet Picker** is not available.  
  
-   Visual F# - The **Code Snippet Picker** is not available.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[jsprjscript](../debug-interface-access/includes/jsprjscript_md.md)] -- Right-click at the desired location in the Code Editor to display the Shortcut menu, and click **Insert Snippet** or **Surround With**.  
  
-   XML - Right-click at the desired location in the Code Editor to display the Shortcut menu, and click **Insert Snippet** or **Surround With**.  
  
-   HTML - Right-click at the desired location in the Code Editor to display the Shortcut menu, and click **Insert Snippet** or **Surround With**.  
  
-   SQL - Right-click at the desired location in the Code Editor to display the Shortcut menu, and click **Insert Snippet**.  
  
 In most Visual Studio development languages, you can use the **Code Snippets Manager** to add folders to the **Folder List** that the **Code Snippet Picker** scans for XML snippet files. You can also create your own snippets to add to the list. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Code Snippet](../ide/walkthrough--creating-a-code-snippet.md).  
  
## UIElement List  
 Item Name  
 An editable text field that displays the name of the item selected in the **Item List**. To perform an incremental search for the item you want, begin typing its name in this field. Continue adding letters until the desired item is selected in the **Item List**.  
  
 Item List  
 A list of code snippets available for insertion, or a list of folders containing code snippets. To insert a snippet or expand a folder, select the item you want and press Enter.
