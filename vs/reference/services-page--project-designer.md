# Services Page, Project Designer
Client application services provide simplified access to [!INCLUDE[ajax_current_short](../reference/includes/ajax_current_short_md.md)] login, roles, and profile services from Windows Forms and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications. You can use the **Services** page of the **Project Designer** to enable and configure client application services for your project.  
  
 With client application services, you can use a centralized server to authenticate users, determine each user's assigned role or roles, and store per-user application settings that you can share across the network. For more information, see [Client Application Services](../Topic/Client%20Application%20Services.md).  
  
 To access the **Services** page, select a project node in **Solution Explorer**, and then click **Properties** on the **Project** menu. When the **Project Designer** appears, click the **Services** tab.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Client application services require the full version of the .NET Framework, and are not supported in the .NET Framework Client Profile. If the **Enable client application services** check box is disabled, verify that the **Target framework** is set to the .NET Framework 3.5 or later. To view the **Target framework** setting in C#, open the Project Designer and then click the **Application** page. To view the **Target framework** setting in Visual Basic, open the Project Designer, click the **Compile** page, and then click **Advanced Compile Options**.  
  
## Task List  
 [How to: Configure Client Application Services](../Topic/How%20to:%20Configure%20Client%20Application%20Services.md)  
  
## UIElement List  
 **Configuration**  
 This control is not editable on this page. For a description of this control, see [Compile Page, Project Designer (Visual Basic)](../reference/compile-page--project-designer--visual-basic-.md) or [Build Page, Project Designer (C#)](../reference/build-page--project-designer--csharp-.md).  
  
 **Platform**  
 This control is not editable on this page. For a description of this control, see [Compile Page, Project Designer (Visual Basic)](../reference/compile-page--project-designer--visual-basic-.md) or [Build Page, Project Designer (C#)](../reference/build-page--project-designer--csharp-.md).  
  
 **Enable client application services**  
 Select to enable client application services. You must specify service locations on the **Services** page to use client application services.  
  
 **Use Windows authentication**  
 Indicates that the authentication provider will use Windows-based authentication, that is, the identity supplied by the Windows operating system.  
  
 **Use Forms authentication**  
 Indicates that the authentication provider will use forms authentication. This means that your application must provide a user interface for login. For more information, see [How to: Implement User Login with Client Application Services](../Topic/How%20to:%20Implement%20User%20Login%20with%20Client%20Application%20Services.md).  
  
 **Authentication service location**  
 Used only with forms authentication. Specifies the location of the authentication service.  
  
 **Optional: Credentials provider**  
 Used only with forms authentication. Indicates the <xref:System.Web.ClientServices.Providers.IClientFormsAuthenticationCredentialsProvider> implementation that the authentication service will use to display a login dialog box when your application calls the `static`<xref:System.Web.Security.Membership.ValidateUser*?displayProperty=fullName> method and passes empty strings or `null` for the parameters. If you leave this box blank, you must pass a valid user name and password to the <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership.ValidateUser*?displayProperty=fullName> method. You must specify the credentials provider as an assembly-qualified type name. For more information, see <xref:System.Type.AssemblyQualifiedName*?displayProperty=fullName> and [Assembly Names](../Topic/Assembly%20Names.md). In its simplest form, an assembly-qualified type name looks similar to the following example: `MyNamespace.MyLoginClass, MyAssembly`  
  
 **Roles service location**  
 Specifies the location of the roles service.  
  
 **Web settings service location**  
 Specifies the location of the profile (Web settings) service.  
  
 **Advanced**  
 Opens the [Advanced Settings for Services Dialog Box](../reference/advanced-settings-for-services-dialog-box.md), which you can use to override default behavior. For example, you can use this dialog box to specify a database for offline storage instead of using the local file system. For more information, see [Advanced Settings for Services Dialog Box](../reference/advanced-settings-for-services-dialog-box.md).
