# How to: Display Line Numbers in the Editor
You can display or hide line numbering in your code.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Depending on your active settings, the dialog boxes and menu commands that appear might differ from the ones that are described here. To change your settings, open **Tools / Import and Export Settings**. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](assetId:///22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
## Display Line Numbers in Code  
 Line numbers aren't added to your code; they're just for reference. If you want line numbers to print, in the **Print** dialog box, select the **Include line numbers** check box.  
  
#### To display line numbers in code  
  
1.  On the menu bar, choose **Tools**, **Options**. Expand the **Text Editor** node, and then select either the node for the language you are using, or **All Languages** to turn on line numbers in all languages. Or you can type **line number** in the **Quick Launch** box.  
  
2.  ![Options for displaying line numbers in the editor](../reference/media/vs_displaylinenumbers.png "VS_DisplayLineNumbers")  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Depending on your language or settings, you may have to select the **Show All Settings** check box in the **Options** dialog box to reveal the **All Languages** sub-node.
