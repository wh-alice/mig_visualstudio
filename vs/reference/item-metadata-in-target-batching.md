# Item Metadata in Target Batching
[!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../extensibility/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)] has the ability to perform dependency analysis on the inputs and outputs of a build target. If it is determined that the inputs or outputs of the target are up-to-date, the target will be skipped and the build will procede. `Target` elements use the `Inputs` and `Outputs` attributes to specify the items to inspect during dependency analysis.  
  
 If a target contains a task that uses batched items as inputs or outputs, the `Target` element of the target should use batching in its `Inputs` or `Outputs` attributes to enable [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../extensibility/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)] to skip batches of items that are already up-to-date.  
  
## Batching Targets  
 The following example contains an item list named `Res` that is divided into two batches based on the `Culture` item metadata. Each of these batches is passed into the `AL` task, which creates an output assembly for each batch. By using batching on the `Outputs` attribute of the `Target` element, [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../extensibility/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)] can determine if each of the individual batches is up-to-date before running the target. Without using target batching, both batches of items would be run by the task every time the target was executed.  
  
```  
<Project  
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">  
  
    <ItemGroup>  
        <Res Include="Strings.fr.resources">  
            <Culture>fr</Culture>  
        </Res>  
        <Res Include="Strings.jp.resources">  
            <Culture>jp</Culture>  
        </Res>  
        <Res Include="Menus.fr.resources">  
            <Culture>fr</Culture>  
        </Res>  
        <Res Include="Dialogs.fr.resources">  
            <Culture>fr</Culture>  
        </Res>  
        <Res Include="Dialogs.jp.resources">  
            <Culture>jp</Culture>  
        </Res>  
        <Res Include="Menus.jp.resources">  
            <Culture>jp</Culture>  
        </Res>  
    </ItemGroup>  
  
    <Target Name="Build"  
        Inputs="@(Res)"  
        Outputs="%(Culture)\MyApp.resources.dll">  
  
        <AL Resources="@(Res)"  
            TargetType="library"  
            OutputAssembly="%(Culture)\MyApp.resources.dll"  
  
    </Target>  
  
</Project>
