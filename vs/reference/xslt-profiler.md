# XSLT Profiler
The XSLT Profiler is a performance analysis profiler tool that helps you develop and debug XSLT documents. The XSLT Profiler allows developers to measure and evaluate performance-related problems in XSLT code by creating detailed XSLT performance reports. The XSLT Profiler includes useful hints for XSL and XSLT style sheet optimizations, which are essential for XSLT-based applications that demand maximum performance.  
  
 The XSLT Profiler is part of Visual Studio 2010 and is available from the Visual Studio **XML** menu.

 The XSLT Profiler was first introduced as an add-in for Visual Studio 2008. For more information, see the Related Resources section on the [XSLT Profiler for Visual Studio Feb 08 Community Technology Preview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=142987) page.
