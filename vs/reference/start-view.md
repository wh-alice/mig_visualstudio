# Start View
The Start View is the launching point for the XML Schema (XSD) Designer. When you create a new XSD file, you will initially see the Start View.  
  
 The Start View contains two main sections, the *watermark* and the **Schema Set Details** pane. It also includes the toolbar, which is available in all the XSD Designer views.

## Watermark  
 The watermark pane contains a list of links to all the XSD Designer views, XML Editor, and XML Schema Explorer. If the schema set has errors, the following text is displayed at the end of the list: "Use the Error List to view and fix the errors in the set."  
  
## Schema Set Details  
 The **Schema Set Details** pane lists the global schema node types, and displays how many instances of each type there are in the schema. You can use the **add** links next to the node types to add new nodes to the workspace.  
  
## Toolbar  
 You can navigate between the Start View, the [Content Model View](../reference/content-model-view.md) and the [Graph View](../reference/graph-view.md) from the XML Schema Designer toolbar.
