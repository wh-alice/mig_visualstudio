# How to: Examine the Content Model of Nodes Using the Content Model View
This topic describes how to explore your nodes using the [Content Model View](../reference/content-model-view.md).  
  
### To create a new XSD file and display the root element in the Content Model View  
  
1.  Create a new XML Schema file.  
  
2.  Click **Use XML Editor to view and edit the underlying XML Schema file** on the Start View.  
  
3.  Copy the XML Schema sample code from [Sample XML Schema: Purchase Order Schema](../reference/sample-xsd-file--purchase-order-schema.md) and paste it to replace the code that was added to the new XSD file by default.  
  
4.  Select the `purchaseOrder` element in the Schema Explorer by right-clicking the `purchaseOrder` element in the XML Editor and selecting **Show in XML Explorer**.  
  
5.  Right-click the `purchaseOrder` in the XML Explorer and select **Show in Content Model View**.  
  
     The Content Model View displays the `purchaseOrder` element on its design surface.  
  
6.  Expand the `shipTo`, `billTo`, and `items` nodes either by double-clicking each node or by clicking the double arrow to the right of each node.  
  
     The nodes of the `purchaseOrder` element are now expanded and you can see the content model of the element.  
  
7.  Click on any node under the `purchaseOrder` element and look at the breadcrumb bar to see where in the schema set the selected node is located.  
  
8.  Click the **Show Documentation** button in the XSD Toolbar to toggle documenation. You can also right-click the design surface to toggle the documentation.  
  
9. Rick-click the `purchaseOrder` node and select **Generate Sample XML** to see the XML instance document.
