# Sorting, Filtering, and Grouping (XML Schema Explorer)
This topic describes the options that are available through the **Sorting, Filtering, and Grouping Options** menu on the XML Schema Explorer toolbar.  
  
## Filter Options  
 The following filter options are available. By default, the **Show Namespaces** and **Show Schema Files** options are selected.  
  
-   **Show Namespaces**.  
  
-   **Show Schema Files**.  
  
-   **Show Compositors (sequence/choice/all)**.  
  
## Sorting Options  
 The following sorting options are available. The default is **Sort By Type**. Sort By options do not apply to files and namespaces.  
  
-   **Sort By Type**.  
  
-   **Sort By Name**.  
  
-   **Document Order**.  
  
### Sort By Type  
 When the **Sort By Type** option is selected, global nodes are sorted in the following order. Nodes are then sorted alphabetically within each group.  
  
1.  `import` nodes.  
  
2.  `include` nodes.  
  
3.  `redefine` nodes.  
  
4.  `attribute` nodes.  
  
5.  `attributeGroup` nodes.  
  
6.  `complexType` nodes.  
  
7.  `simpleType` nodes.  
  
8.  `element` nodes.  
  
9. `group` nodes.  
  
### Sort By Name  
 When the **Sort By Name** option is selected, global nodes are sorted in the following order:  
  
1.  `import` nodes (in alphabetical order of namespaces).  
  
2.  `include` nodes (in alphabetical order of `schemaLocation` attributes).  
  
3.  `redefine` nodes (in alphabetical order of `schemaLocation` attributes).  
  
4.  Other global nodes in alphabetical order.  
  
### Document Order  
 The **Document Order** option is available when the **Show Schema Files** option is selected. When **Document Order** is selected, global nodes are displayed in the order in which they appear in the schema file.  
  
## Persisting Sort/Filter Options  
 The sorting, filtering, and grouping options are saved to the registry for each user, no matter which solution or files were open when the settings were changed.
