# New File Command
Creates a new file and opens it. The file appears under the Miscellaneous Files folder.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
File.NewFile [filename] [/t:templatename] [/editor:editorname]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `filename`  
 Optional. Name for the file. If no name is supplied, a default name is provided. If no template name is listed, a text file is created.  
  
## Switches  
 /t:`templatename`  
 Optional. Specifies the type of file to be created.  
  
 The /t:`templatename` argument syntax mirrors the information found in the New File Dialog Box. Enter the category name followed by a backslash (`\`) and the template name, and enclose the entire string in quotation marks.  
  
 For example, to create a new [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../code-quality/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] source file, you would enter the following for the /t:`templatename` argument.  
  
```  
/t:"Visual C++\C++ File (.cpp)"  
```  
  
 The example above indicates that the C++ File template is located under the Visual C++ category in the **New File** dialog box.  
  
 /e:`editorname`  
 Optional. Name of the editor in which the file will be opened. If the argument is specified but no editor name is supplied, the **Open With** dialog box appears.  
  
 The /e:`editorname` argument syntax uses the editor names as they appear in the Open With Dialog Box, enclosed in quotation marks.  
  
 For example, to open a file in the source code editor, you would enter the following for the /e:`editorname` argument.  
  
```  
/e:"Source Code (text) Editor"  
```  
  
## Example  
 This example creates a new Web page "test1.htm" and opens it in the source code editor.  
  
```  
>File.NewFile test1 /t:"General\HTML Page" /e:"Source Code (text) Editor"  
```
